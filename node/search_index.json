documentation is to comprehensively explain the Node.js\nAPI, both from a reference as well as a conceptual point of view.  Each\nsection describes a built-in module or high-level concept.\nWhere appropriate, property types, method arguments, and the arguments\nprovided to event handlers are detailed in a list underneath the topic\nheading.\nEvery .html document has a corresponding .json document presenting\nthe same information in a structured manner.  This feature is\nexperimental, and added for the benefit of IDEs and other utilities that\nwish to do programmatic things with the documentation.\nEvery .html and .json file is generated based on the corresponding\n.md file in the doc/api/ folder in Node.js&#39;s source tree.  The\ndocumentation is generated using the tools/doc/generate.js program.\nThe HTML template is located at doc/template.html.\nIf you find an error in this documentation, please submit an issue\nor see the contributing guide for directions on how to submit a patch.\nStability Index\n\nThroughout the documentation, you will see indications of a section&#39;s\nstability.  The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it\nmatures, certain parts are more reliable than others.  Some are so\nproven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at\nall.  Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous\nand in the process of being redesigned.\nThe stability indices are as follows:\nStability: 0 - Deprecated\nThis feature is known to be problematic, and changes are\nplanned.  Do not rely on it.  Use of the feature may cause warnings.  Backwards\ncompatibility should not be expected.\n\nStability: 1 - Experimental\nThis feature is subject to change, and is gated by a command line flag.\nIt may change or be removed in future versions.\n\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe API has proven satisfactory. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem\nis a high priority, and will not be broken unless absolutely necessary.\n\nStability: 3 - Locked\nOnly fixes related to security, performance, or bug fixes will be accepted.\nPlease do not suggest API changes in this area; they will be refused.\n\nJSON Output\nStability: 1 - Experimental\nEvery HTML file in the markdown has a corresponding JSON file with the\nsame data.\nThis feature was added in Node.js v0.6.12.  It is experimental.\nSyscalls and man pages\nSystem calls like open(2) and read(2) define the interface between user programs\nand the underlying operating system. Node functions which simply wrap a syscall,\nlike fs.open(), will document that. The docs link to the corresponding man\npages (short for manual pages) which describe how the syscalls work.\nCaveat: some syscalls, like lchown(2), are BSD-specific. That means, for\nexample, that fs.lchown() only works on Mac OS X and other BSD-derived systems,\nand is not available on Linux.\nMost Unix syscalls have Windows equivalents, but behavior may differ on Windows\nrelative to Linux and OS X. For an example of the subtle ways in which it&#39;s\nsometimes impossible to replace Unix syscall semantics on Windows, see Node\nissue 4760.\n"},"synopsis.html":{"url":"synopsis.html","title":"Usage & Example","body":"title: synopsis\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nUsage\n\nnode [options] [v8 options] [script.js | -e &quot;script&quot;] [arguments]\nPlease see the Command Line Options document for information about\ndifferent options and ways to run scripts with Node.js.\nExample\nAn example of a web server written with Node.js which responds with\n&#39;Hello World&#39;:\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\n\nconst hostname = &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;;\nconst port = 3000;\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(&#39;Content-Type&#39;, &#39;text/plain&#39;);\n  res.end(&#39;Hello World\\n&#39;);\n});\n\nserver.listen(port, hostname, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);\n});\n\nTo run the server, put the code into a file called example.js and execute\nit with Node.js:\n$ node example.js\nServer running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/\n\nAll of the examples in the documentation can be run similarly.\n"},"assert.html":{"url":"assert.html","title":"Assertion Testing","body":"title: assert\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nAssert\nStability: 3 - Locked\nThe assert module provides a simple set of assertion tests that can be used to\ntest invariants. The module is intended for internal use by Node.js, but can be\nused in application code via require(&#39;assert&#39;). However, assert is not a\ntesting framework, and is not intended to be used as a general purpose assertion\nlibrary.\nThe API for the assert module is Locked. This means that there will be no\nadditions or changes to any of the methods implemented and exposed by\nthe module.\nassert(value[, message])\n\nAn alias of assert.ok() .\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\n\nassert(true);  // OK\nassert(1);     // OK\nassert(false);\n  // throws &quot;AssertionError: false == true&quot;\nassert(0);\n  // throws &quot;AssertionError: 0 == true&quot;\nassert(false, &#39;it\\&#39;s false&#39;);\n  // throws &quot;AssertionError: it&#39;s false&quot;\n\nassert.deepEqual(actual, expected[, message])\n\nTests for deep equality between the actual and expected parameters.\nPrimitive values are compared with the equal comparison operator ( == ).\nOnly enumerable &quot;own&quot; properties are considered. The deepEqual()\nimplementation does not test object prototypes, attached symbols, or\nnon-enumerable properties. This can lead to some potentially surprising\nresults. For example, the following example does not throw an AssertionError\nbecause the properties on the Error object are non-enumerable:\n// WARNING: This does not throw an AssertionError!\nassert.deepEqual(Error(&#39;a&#39;), Error(&#39;b&#39;));\n\n&quot;Deep&quot; equality means that the enumerable &quot;own&quot; properties of child objects\nare evaluated also:\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\n\nconst obj1 = {\n  a : {\n    b : 1\n  }\n};\nconst obj2 = {\n  a : {\n    b : 2\n  }\n};\nconst obj3 = {\n  a : {\n    b : 1\n  }\n};\nconst obj4 = Object.create(obj1);\n\nassert.deepEqual(obj1, obj1);\n  // OK, object is equal to itself\n\nassert.deepEqual(obj1, obj2);\n  // AssertionError: { a: { b: 1 } } deepEqual { a: { b: 2 } }\n  // values of b are different\n\nassert.deepEqual(obj1, obj3);\n  // OK, objects are equal\n\nassert.deepEqual(obj1, obj4);\n  // AssertionError: { a: { b: 1 } } deepEqual {}\n  // Prototypes are ignored\n\nIf the values are not equal, an AssertionError is thrown with a message\nproperty set equal to the value of the message parameter. If the message\nparameter is undefined, a default error message is assigned.\nassert.deepStrictEqual(actual, expected[, message])\n\nGenerally identical to assert.deepEqual() with two exceptions. First,\nprimitive values are compared using the strict equality operator ( === ).\nSecond, object comparisons include a strict equality check of their prototypes.\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\n\nassert.deepEqual({a:1}, {a:&#39;1&#39;});\n  // OK, because 1 == &#39;1&#39;\n\nassert.deepStrictEqual({a:1}, {a:&#39;1&#39;});\n  // AssertionError: { a: 1 } deepStrictEqual { a: &#39;1&#39; }\n  // because 1 !== &#39;1&#39; using strict equality\n\nIf the values are not equal, an AssertionError is thrown with a message\nproperty set equal to the value of the message parameter. If the message\nparameter is undefined, a default error message is assigned.\nassert.doesNotThrow(block[, error][, message])\n\nAsserts that the function block does not throw an error. See\nassert.throws() for more details.\nWhen assert.doesNotThrow() is called, it will immediately call the block\nfunction.\nIf an error is thrown and it is the same type as that specified by the error\nparameter, then an AssertionError is thrown. If the error is of a different\ntype, or if the error parameter is undefined, the error is propagated back\nto the caller.\nThe following, for instance, will throw the TypeError because there is no\nmatching error type in the assertion:\nassert.doesNotThrow(\n  () =&gt; {\n    throw new TypeError(&#39;Wrong value&#39;);\n  },\n  SyntaxError\n);\n\nHowever, the following will result in an AssertionError with the message\n&#39;Got unwanted exception (TypeError)..&#39;:\nassert.doesNotThrow(\n  () =&gt; {\n    throw new TypeError(&#39;Wrong value&#39;);\n  },\n  TypeError\n);\n\nIf an AssertionError is thrown and a value is provided for the message\nparameter, the value of message will be appended to the AssertionError\nmessage:\nassert.doesNotThrow(\n  () =&gt; {\n    throw new TypeError(&#39;Wrong value&#39;);\n  },\n  TypeError,\n  &#39;Whoops&#39;\n);\n// Throws: AssertionError: Got unwanted exception (TypeError). Whoops\n\nassert.equal(actual, expected[, message])\n\nTests shallow, coercive equality between the actual and expected parameters\nusing the equal comparison operator ( == ).\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\n\nassert.equal(1, 1);\n  // OK, 1 == 1\nassert.equal(1, &#39;1&#39;);\n  // OK, 1 == &#39;1&#39;\n\nassert.equal(1, 2);\n  // AssertionError: 1 == 2\nassert.equal({a: {b: 1}}, {a: {b: 1}});\n  //AssertionError: { a: { b: 1 } } == { a: { b: 1 } }\n\nIf the values are not equal, an AssertionError is thrown with a message\nproperty set equal to the value of the message parameter. If the message\nparameter is undefined, a default error message is assigned.\nassert.fail(actual, expected, message, operator)\n\nThrows an AssertionError. If message is falsy, the error message is set as\nthe values of actual and expected separated by the provided operator.\nOtherwise, the error message is the value of message.\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\n\nassert.fail(1, 2, undefined, &#39;&gt;&#39;);\n  // AssertionError: 1 &gt; 2\n\nassert.fail(1, 2, &#39;whoops&#39;, &#39;&gt;&#39;);\n  // AssertionError: whoops\n\nassert.ifError(value)\n\nThrows value if value is truthy. This is useful when testing the error\nargument in callbacks.\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\n\nassert.ifError(0); // OK\nassert.ifError(1); // Throws 1\nassert.ifError(&#39;error&#39;); // Throws &#39;error&#39;\nassert.ifError(new Error()); // Throws Error\n\nassert.notDeepEqual(actual, expected[, message])\n\nTests for any deep inequality. Opposite of assert.deepEqual().\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\n\nconst obj1 = {\n  a : {\n    b : 1\n  }\n};\nconst obj2 = {\n  a : {\n    b : 2\n  }\n};\nconst obj3 = {\n  a : {\n    b : 1\n  }\n};\nconst obj4 = Object.create(obj1);\n\nassert.notDeepEqual(obj1, obj1);\n  // AssertionError: { a: { b: 1 } } notDeepEqual { a: { b: 1 } }\n\nassert.notDeepEqual(obj1, obj2);\n  // OK, obj1 and obj2 are not deeply equal\n\nassert.notDeepEqual(obj1, obj3);\n  // AssertionError: { a: { b: 1 } } notDeepEqual { a: { b: 1 } }\n\nassert.notDeepEqual(obj1, obj4);\n  // OK, obj1 and obj2 are not deeply equal\n\nIf the values are deeply equal, an AssertionError is thrown with a message\nproperty set equal to the value of the message parameter. If the message\nparameter is undefined, a default error message is assigned.\nassert.notDeepStrictEqual(actual, expected[, message])\n\nTests for deep strict inequality. Opposite of assert.deepStrictEqual().\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\n\nassert.notDeepEqual({a:1}, {a:&#39;1&#39;});\n  // AssertionError: { a: 1 } notDeepEqual { a: &#39;1&#39; }\n\nassert.notDeepStrictEqual({a:1}, {a:&#39;1&#39;});\n  // OK\n\nIf the values are deeply and strictly equal, an AssertionError is thrown\nwith a message property set equal to the value of the message parameter.

If the\nmessage parameter is undefined, a default error message is assigned.\nassert.throws(block[, error][, message])\n\nExpects the function block to throw an error.\nIf specified, error can be a constructor, RegExp, or validation\nfunction.\nIf specified, message will be the message provided by the AssertionError if\nthe block fails to throw.\nValidate instanceof using constructor:\nassert.throws(\n  () =&gt; {\n    throw new Error(&#39;Wrong value&#39;);\n  },\n  Error\n);\n\nValidate error message using RegExp:\nassert.throws(\n  () =&gt; {\n    throw new Error(&#39;Wrong value&#39;);\n  },\n  /value/\n);\n\nCustom error validation:\nassert.throws(\n  () =&gt; {\n    throw new Error(&#39;Wrong value&#39;);\n  },\n  function(err) {\n    if ( (err instanceof Error) &amp;&amp; /value/.test(err) ) {\n      return true;\n    }\n  },\n  &#39;unexpected error&#39;\n);\n\nNote that error can not be a string.

The Buffer class was introduced as part of the Node.js\nAPI to make it possible to interact with octet streams in the context of things\nlike TCP streams and file system operations.\nNow that TypedArray has been added in ES6, the Buffer class implements the\nUint8Array API in a manner that is more optimized and suitable for Node.js&#39;\nuse cases.\nInstances of the Buffer class are similar to arrays of integers but\ncorrespond to fixed-sized, raw memory allocations outside the V8 heap.\nThe size of the Buffer is established when it is created and cannot be\nresized.\nThe Buffer class is a global within Node.js, making it unlikely that one\nwould need to ever use require(&#39;buffer&#39;).Buffer.\nExamples:\n// Creates a zero-filled Buffer of length 10.\nconst buf1 = Buffer.alloc(10);\n\n// Creates a Buffer of length 10, filled with 0x1.\nconst buf2 = Buffer.alloc(10, 1);\n\n// Creates an uninitialized buffer of length 10.\n// This is faster than calling Buffer.alloc() but the returned\n// Buffer instance might contain old data that needs to be\n// overwritten using either fill() or write().\nconst buf3 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);\n\n// Creates a Buffer containing [0x1, 0x2, 0x3].\nconst buf4 = Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]);\n\n// Creates a Buffer containing ASCII bytes [0x74, 0x65, 0x73, 0x74].\nconst buf5 = Buffer.from(&#39;test&#39;);\n\n// Creates a Buffer containing UTF-8 bytes [0x74, 0xc3, 0xa9, 0x73, 0x74].\nconst buf6 = Buffer.from(&#39;tést&#39;, &#39;utf8&#39;);\n\nBuffer.from(), Buffer.alloc(), and Buffer.allocUnsafe()\nIn versions of Node.js prior to v6, Buffer instances were created using the\nBuffer constructor function, which allocates the returned Buffer\ndifferently based on what arguments are provided:\n\nPassing a number as the first argument to Buffer() (e.g. new Buffer(10)),\nallocates a new Buffer object of the specified size. The memory allocated\nfor such Buffer instances is not initialized and can contain sensitive\ndata. Such Buffer instances must be initialized manually by using either\nbuf.fill(0) or by writing to the Buffer completely. While\nthis behavior is intentional to improve performance, development experience\nhas demonstrated that a more explicit distinction is required between creating\na fast-but-uninitialized Buffer versus creating a slower-but-safer Buffer.\nPassing a string, array, or Buffer as the first argument copies the\npassed object&#39;s data into the Buffer.\nPassing an ArrayBuffer returns a Buffer that shares allocated memory with\nthe given ArrayBuffer.\n\nBecause the behavior of new Buffer() changes significantly based on the type\nof value passed as the first argument, applications that do not properly\nvalidate the input arguments passed to new Buffer(), or that fail to\nappropriately initialize newly allocated Buffer content, can inadvertently\nintroduce security and reliability issues into their code.\nTo make the creation of Buffer instances more reliable and less error prone,\nthe various forms of the new Buffer() constructor have been deprecated\nand replaced by separate Buffer.from(), Buffer.alloc(), and\nBuffer.allocUnsafe() methods.\nDevelopers should migrate all existing uses of the new Buffer() constructors\nto one of these new APIs.\n\nBuffer.from(array) returns a new Buffer containing a copy of the provided\noctets.\nBuffer.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset [, length]])\nreturns a new Buffer that shares the same allocated memory as the given\nArrayBuffer.\nBuffer.from(buffer) returns a new Buffer containing a copy of the\ncontents of the given Buffer.\nBuffer.from(string[, encoding]) returns a new Buffer\ncontaining a copy of the provided string.\nBuffer.alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]]) returns a &quot;filled&quot;\nBuffer instance of the specified size. This method can be significantly\nslower than Buffer.allocUnsafe(size) but ensures\nthat newly created Buffer instances never contain old and potentially\nsensitive data.\nBuffer.allocUnsafe(size) and\nBuffer.allocUnsafeSlow(size) each return a\nnew Buffer of the specified size whose content must be initialized\nusing either buf.fill(0) or written to completely.\n\nBuffer instances returned by Buffer.allocUnsafe() may be allocated off\na shared internal memory pool if size is less than or equal to half\nBuffer.poolSize. Instances returned by Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow() never\nuse the shared internal memory pool.\nThe --zero-fill-buffers command line option\n\nNode.js can be started using the --zero-fill-buffers command line option to\nforce all newly allocated Buffer instances created using either\nnew Buffer(size), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow() or\nnew SlowBuffer(size) to be automatically zero-filled upon creation. Use of\nthis flag changes the default behavior of these methods and can have a significant\nimpact on performance. Use of the --zero-fill-buffers option is recommended\nonly when necessary to enforce that newly allocated Buffer instances cannot\ncontain potentially sensitive data.\nExample:\n$ node --zero-fill-buffers\n&gt; Buffer.allocUnsafe(5);\n&lt;Buffer 00 00 00 00 00&gt;\n\nWhat makes Buffer.allocUnsafe() and Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow() &quot;unsafe&quot;?\nWhen calling Buffer.allocUnsafe() and Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(), the\nsegment of allocated memory is uninitialized (it is not zeroed-out). While\nthis design makes the allocation of memory quite fast, the allocated segment of\nmemory might contain old data that is potentially sensitive. Using a Buffer\ncreated by Buffer.allocUnsafe() without completely overwriting the memory\ncan allow this old data to be leaked when the Buffer memory is read.\nWhile there are clear performance advantages to using Buffer.allocUnsafe(),\nextra care must be taken in order to avoid introducing security\nvulnerabilities into an application.\nBuffers and Character Encodings\nBuffer instances are commonly used to represent sequences of encoded characters\nsuch as UTF-8, UCS2, Base64 or even Hex-encoded data. It is possible to\nconvert back and forth between Buffer instances and ordinary JavaScript strings\nby using an explicit character encoding.\nExample:\nconst buf = Buffer.from(&#39;hello world&#39;, &#39;ascii&#39;);\n\n// Prints: 68656c6c6f20776f726c64\nconsole.log(buf.toString(&#39;hex&#39;));\n\n// Prints: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=\nconsole.log(buf.toString(&#39;base64&#39;));\n\nThe character encodings currently supported by Node.js include:\n\n&#39;ascii&#39; - for 7-bit ASCII data only. This encoding is fast and will strip\nthe high bit if set.\n\n&#39;utf8&#39; - Multibyte encoded Unicode characters. Many web pages and other\ndocument formats use UTF-8.\n\n&#39;utf16le&#39; - 2 or 4 bytes, little-endian encoded Unicode characters.\nSurrogate pairs (U+10000 to U+10FFFF) are supported.\n\n&#39;ucs2&#39; - Alias of &#39;utf16le&#39;.\n\n&#39;base64&#39; - Base64 encoding. When creating a Buffer from a string,\nthis encoding will also correctly accept &quot;URL and Filename Safe Alphabet&quot; as\nspecified in RFC4648, Section 5.\n\n&#39;latin1&#39; - A way of encoding the Buffer into a one-byte encoded string\n(as defined by the IANA in RFC1345,\npage 63, to be the Latin-1 supplement block and C0/C1 control codes).\n\n&#39;binary&#39; - Alias for &#39;latin1&#39;.\n\n&#39;hex&#39; - Encode each byte as two hexadecimal characters.\n\n\nNote: Today&#39;s browsers follow the WHATWG spec which aliases both &#39;latin1&#39; and\nISO-8859-1 to win-1252. This means that while doing something like http.get(),\nif the returned charset is one of those listed in the WHATWG spec it&#39;s possible\nthat the server actually returned win-1252-encoded data, and using &#39;latin1&#39;\nencoding may incorrectly decode the characters.\nBuffers and TypedArray\nBuffer instances are also Uint8Array instances. However, there are subtle\nincompatibilities with the TypedArray specification in ECMAScript 2015.\nFor example, while ArrayBuffer#slice() creates a copy of the slice, the\nimplementation of Buffer#slice() creates a view over the\nexisting Buffer without copying, making Buffer#slice() far\nmore efficient.\nIt is also possible to create new TypedArray instances from a Buffer with\nthe following caveats:\n\nThe Buffer object&#39;s memory is copied to the TypedArray, not shared.\n\nThe Buffer object&#39;s memory is interpreted as an array of distinct\nelements, and not as a byte array of the target type. That is,\nnew Uint32Array(Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4])) creates a 4-element Uint32Array\nwith elements [1, 2, 3, 4], not a Uint32Array with a single element\n[0x1020304] or [0x4030201].\n\n\nIt is possible to create a new Buffer that shares the same allocated memory as\na TypedArray instance by using the TypeArray object&#39;s .buffer property.\nExample:\nconst arr = new Uint16Array(2);\n\narr[0] = 5000;\narr[1] = 4000;\n\n// Copies the contents of `arr`\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from(arr);\n\n// Shares memory with `arr`\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from(arr.buffer);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 88 a0&gt;\nconsole.log(buf1);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 88 13 a0 0f&gt;\nconsole.log(buf2);\n\narr[1] = 6000;\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 88 a0&gt;\nconsole.log(buf1);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 88 13 70 17&gt;\nconsole.log(buf2);\n\nNote that when creating a Buffer using a TypedArray&#39;s .buffer, it is\npossible to use only a portion of the underlying ArrayBuffer by passing in\nbyteOffset and length parameters.\nExample:\nconst arr = new Uint16Array(20);\nconst buf = Buffer.from(arr.buffer, 0, 16);\n\n// Prints: 16\nconsole.log(buf.length);\n\nThe Buffer.from() and TypedArray.from() (e.g. Uint8Array.from()) have\ndifferent signatures and implementations. Specifically, the TypedArray variants\naccept a second argument that is a mapping function that is invoked on every\nelement of the typed array:\n\nTypedArray.from(source[, mapFn[, thisArg]])\n\nThe Buffer.from() method, however, does not support the use of a mapping\nfunction:\n\nBuffer.from(array)\nBuffer.from(buffer)\nBuffer.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset [, length]])\nBuffer.from(string[, encoding])\n\nBuffers and ES6 iteration\nBuffer instances can be iterated over using the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) for..of\nsyntax.\nExample:\nconst buf = Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]);\n\n// Prints:\n//   1\n//   2\n//   3\nfor (var b of buf) {\n  console.log(b);\n}\n\nAdditionally, the buf.values(), buf.keys(), and\nbuf.entries() methods can be used to create iterators.\nClass: Buffer\nThe Buffer class is a global type for dealing with binary data directly.\nIt can be constructed in a variety of ways.\nnew Buffer(array)\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`Buffer.from(array)`] instead.\n\narray {Array} An array of bytes to copy from\n\nAllocates a new Buffer using an array of octets.\nExample:\n// Creates a new Buffer containing the ASCII bytes of the string &#39;buffer&#39;\nconst buf = new Buffer([0x62, 0x75, 0x66, 0x66, 0x65, 0x72]);\n\nnew Buffer(buffer)\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`Buffer.from(buffer)`] instead.\n\nbuffer {Buffer} An existing Buffer to copy data from\n\nCopies the passed buffer data onto a new Buffer instance.\nExample:\nconst buf1 = new Buffer(&#39;buffer&#39;);\nconst buf2 = new Buffer(buf1);\n\nbuf1[0] = 0x61;\n\n// Prints: auffer\nconsole.log(buf1.toString());\n\n// Prints: buffer\nconsole.log(buf2.toString());\n\nnew Buffer(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset [, length]])\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use\n[`Buffer.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset [, length]])`][`Buffer.from(arrayBuffer)`]\ninstead.\n\narrayBuffer {ArrayBuffer} The .buffer property of a TypedArray or\nArrayBuffer\nbyteOffset {Integer} Where to start copying from arrayBuffer. Default: 0\nlength {Integer} How many bytes to copy from arrayBuffer.\nDefault: arrayBuffer.length - byteOffset\n\nWhen passed a reference to the .buffer property of a TypedArray instance,\nthe newly created Buffer will share the same allocated memory as the\nTypedArray.\nThe optional byteOffset and length arguments specify a memory range within\nthe arrayBuffer that will be shared by the Buffer.\nExample:\nconst arr = new Uint16Array(2);\n\narr[0] = 5000;\narr[1] = 4000;\n\n// Shares memory with `arr`\nconst buf = new Buffer(arr.buffer);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 88 13 a0 0f&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\n// Changing the original Uint16Array changes the Buffer also\narr[1] = 6000;\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 88 13 70 17&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nnew Buffer(size)\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`Buffer.alloc()`] instead (also see\n[`Buffer.allocUnsafe()`]).\n\nsize {Integer} The desired length of the new Buffer\n\nAllocates a new Buffer of size bytes.  The size must be less than or equal\nto the value of buffer.kMaxLength. Otherwise, a RangeError is thrown.\nA zero-length Buffer will be created if size &lt;= 0.\nUnlike ArrayBuffers, the underlying memory for Buffer instances\ncreated in this way is not initialized. The contents of a newly created Buffer\nare unknown and could contain sensitive data. Use buf.fill(0)\nto initialize a Buffer to zeroes.\nExample:\nconst buf = new Buffer(5);\n\n// Prints (contents may vary): &lt;Buffer 78 e0 82 02 01&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nbuf.fill(0);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 00 00 00 00 00&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nnew Buffer(string[, encoding])\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated:\nUse [`Buffer.from(string[, encoding])`][`Buffer.from(string)`] instead.\n\nstring {String} String to encode\nencoding {String} The encoding of string.

If\nprovided, the encoding parameter identifies the character encoding of string.\nExamples:\nconst buf1 = new Buffer(&#39;this is a tést&#39;);\n\n// Prints: this is a tést\nconsole.log(buf1.toString());\n\n// Prints: this is a tC)st\nconsole.log(buf1.toString(&#39;ascii&#39;));\n\n\nconst buf2 = new Buffer(&#39;7468697320697320612074c3a97374&#39;, &#39;hex&#39;);\n\n// Prints: this is a tést\nconsole.log(buf2.toString());\n\nClass Method: Buffer.alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]])\n\n\nsize {Integer} The desired length of the new Buffer\nfill {String | Buffer | Integer} A value to pre-fill the new Buffer with.\nDefault: 0\nencoding {String} If fill is a string, this is its encoding.\nDefault: &#39;utf8&#39;\n\nAllocates a new Buffer of size bytes. If fill is undefined, the\nBuffer will be zero-filled.\nExample:\nconst buf = Buffer.alloc(5);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 00 00 00 00 00&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nThe size must be less than or equal to the value of buffer.kMaxLength.\nOtherwise, a RangeError is thrown. A zero-length Buffer will be created if\nsize &lt;= 0.\nIf fill is specified, the allocated Buffer will be initialized by calling\nbuf.fill(fill).\nExample:\nconst buf = Buffer.alloc(5, &#39;a&#39;);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 61 61 61 61 61&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nIf both fill and encoding are specified, the allocated Buffer will be\ninitialized by calling buf.fill(fill, encoding).\nExample:\nconst buf = Buffer.alloc(11, &#39;aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=&#39;, &#39;base64&#39;);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nCalling Buffer.alloc() can be significantly slower than the alternative\nBuffer.allocUnsafe() but ensures that the newly created Buffer instance\ncontents will never contain sensitive data.\nA TypeError will be thrown if size is not a number.\nClass Method: Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)\n\n\nsize {Integer} The desired length of the new Buffer\n\nAllocates a new non-zero-filled Buffer of size bytes. The size must\nbe less than or equal to the value of buffer.kMaxLength. Otherwise, a\nRangeError is thrown. A zero-length Buffer will be created if size &lt;= 0.\nThe underlying memory for Buffer instances created in this way is not\ninitialized. The contents of the newly created Buffer are unknown and\nmay contain sensitive data. Use buf.fill(0) to initialize such\nBuffer instances to zeroes.\nExample:\nconst buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5);\n\n// Prints (contents may vary): &lt;Buffer 78 e0 82 02 01&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nbuf.fill(0);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 00 00 00 00 00&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nA TypeError will be thrown if size is not a number.\nNote that the Buffer module pre-allocates an internal Buffer instance of\nsize Buffer.poolSize that is used as a pool for the fast allocation of new\nBuffer instances created using Buffer.allocUnsafe() (and the deprecated\nnew Buffer(size) constructor) only when size is less than or equal to\nBuffer.poolSize &gt;&gt; 1 (floor of Buffer.poolSize divided by two).\nUse of this pre-allocated internal memory pool is a key difference between\ncalling Buffer.alloc(size, fill) vs. Buffer.allocUnsafe(size).fill(fill).\nSpecifically, Buffer.alloc(size, fill) will never use the internal Buffer\npool, while Buffer.allocUnsafe(size).fill(fill) will use the internal\nBuffer pool if size is less than or equal to half Buffer.poolSize. The\ndifference is subtle but can be important when an application requires the\nadditional performance that Buffer.allocUnsafe() provides.\nClass Method: Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(size)\n\n\nsize {Integer} The desired length of the new Buffer\n\nAllocates a new non-zero-filled and non-pooled Buffer of size bytes. The\nsize must be less than or equal to the value of buffer.kMaxLength.\nOtherwise, a RangeError is thrown. A zero-length Buffer will be created if\nsize &lt;= 0.\nThe underlying memory for Buffer instances created in this way is not\ninitialized. The contents of the newly created Buffer are unknown and\nmay contain sensitive data. Use buf.fill(0) to initialize such\nBuffer instances to zeroes.\nWhen using Buffer.allocUnsafe() to allocate new Buffer instances,\nallocations under 4KB are, by default, sliced from a single pre-allocated\nBuffer. This allows applications to avoid the garbage collection overhead of\ncreating many individually allocated Buffer instances. This approach improves\nboth performance and memory usage by eliminating the need to track and cleanup as\nmany Persistent objects.\nHowever, in the case where a developer may need to retain a small chunk of\nmemory from a pool for an indeterminate amount of time, it may be appropriate\nto create an un-pooled Buffer instance using Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow() then\ncopy out the relevant bits.\nExample:\n// Need to keep around a few small chunks of memory\nconst store = [];\n\nsocket.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  const data = socket.read();\n\n  // Allocate for retained data\n  const sb = Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(10);\n\n  // Copy the data into the new allocation\n  data.copy(sb, 0, 0, 10);\n\n  store.push(sb);\n});\n\nUse of Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow() should be used only as a last resort after\na developer has observed undue memory retention in their applications.\nA TypeError will be thrown if size is not a number.\nClass Method: Buffer.byteLength(string[, encoding])\n\n\nstring {String | Buffer | TypedArray | DataView | ArrayBuffer} A value to\ncalculate the length of\nencoding {String} If string is a string, this is its encoding.\nDefault: &#39;utf8&#39;\nReturn: {Integer} The number of bytes contained within string\n\nReturns the actual byte length of a string. This is not the same as\nString.prototype.length since that returns the number of characters in\na string.\nExample:\nconst str = &#39;\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be&#39;;\n\n// Prints: ½ + ¼ = ¾: 9 characters, 12 bytes\nconsole.log(`${str}: ${str.length} characters, ` +\n            `${Buffer.byteLength(str, &#39;utf8&#39;)} bytes`);\n\nWhen string is a Buffer/DataView/TypedArray/ArrayBuffer, the\nactual byte length is returned.\nOtherwise, converts to String and returns the byte length of string.\nClass Method: Buffer.compare(buf1, buf2)\n\n\nbuf1 {Buffer}\nbuf2 {Buffer}\nReturn: {Integer}\n\nCompares buf1 to buf2 typically for the purpose of sorting arrays of\nBuffer instances. This is equivalent to calling\nbuf1.compare(buf2).\nExample:\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from(&#39;1234&#39;);\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from(&#39;0123&#39;);\nconst arr = [buf1, buf2];\n\n// Prints: [ &lt;Buffer 30 31 32 33&gt;, &lt;Buffer 31 32 33 34&gt; ]\n// (This result is equal to: [buf2, buf1])\nconsole.log(arr.sort(Buffer.compare));\n\nClass Method: Buffer.concat(list[, totalLength])\n\n\nlist {Array} List of Buffer instances to concat\ntotalLength {Integer} Total length of the Buffer instances in list\nwhen concatenated\nReturn: {Buffer}\n\nReturns a new Buffer which is the result of concatenating all the Buffer\ninstances in the list together.\nIf the list has no items, or if the totalLength is 0, then a new zero-length\nBuffer is returned.\nIf totalLength is not provided, it is calculated from the Buffer instances\nin list. This however causes an additional loop to be executed in order to\ncalculate the totalLength, so it is faster to provide the length explicitly if\nit is already known.\nExample: Create a single Buffer from a list of three Buffer instances\nconst buf1 = Buffer.alloc(10);\nconst buf2 = Buffer.alloc(14);\nconst buf3 = Buffer.alloc(18);\nconst totalLength = buf1.length + buf2.length + buf3.length;\n\n// Prints: 42\nconsole.log(totalLength);\n\nconst bufA = Buffer.concat([buf1, buf2, buf3], totalLength);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 00 00 00 00 ...&gt;\nconsole.log(bufA);\n\n// Prints: 42\nconsole.log(bufA.length);\n\nClass Method: Buffer.from(array)\n\n\narray {Array}\n\nAllocates a new Buffer using an array of octets.\nExample:\n// Creates a new Buffer containing ASCII bytes of the string &#39;buffer&#39;\nconst buf = Buffer.from([0x62, 0x75, 0x66, 0x66, 0x65, 0x72]);\n\nA TypeError will be thrown if array is not an Array.\nClass Method: Buffer.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]])\n\n\narrayBuffer {ArrayBuffer} The .buffer property of a TypedArray or\nArrayBuffer\nbyteOffset {Integer} Where to start copying from arrayBuffer. Default: 0\nlength {Integer} How many bytes to copy from arrayBuffer.\nDefault: arrayBuffer.length - byteOffset\n\nWhen passed a reference to the .buffer property of a TypedArray instance,\nthe newly created Buffer will share the same allocated memory as the\nTypedArray.\nExample:\nconst arr = new Uint16Array(2);\n\narr[0] = 5000;\narr[1] = 4000;\n\n// Shares memory with `arr`\nconst buf = Buffer.from(arr.buffer);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 88 13 a0 0f&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\n// Changing the original Uint16Array changes the Buffer also\narr[1] = 6000;\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 88 13 70 17&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nThe optional byteOffset and length arguments specify a memory range within\nthe arrayBuffer that will be shared by the Buffer.\nExample:\nconst ab = new ArrayBuffer(10);\nconst buf = Buffer.from(ab, 0, 2);\n\n// Prints: 2\nconsole.log(buf.length);\n\nA TypeError will be thrown if arrayBuffer is not an ArrayBuffer.\nClass Method: Buffer.from(buffer)\n\n\nbuffer {Buffer} An existing Buffer to copy data from\n\nCopies the passed buffer data onto a new Buffer instance.\nExample:\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from(&#39;buffer&#39;);\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from(buf1);\n\nbuf1[0] = 0x61;\n\n// Prints: auffer\nconsole.log(buf1.toString());\n\n// Prints: buffer\nconsole.log(buf2.toString());\n\nA TypeError will be thrown if buffer is not a Buffer.\nClass Method: Buffer.from(string[, encoding])\n\n\nstring {String} A string to encode.\nencoding {String} The encoding of string. Default: &#39;utf8&#39;\n\nCreates a new Buffer containing the given JavaScript string string. If\nprovided, the encoding parameter identifies the character encoding of string.\nExamples:\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from(&#39;this is a tést&#39;);\n\n// Prints: this is a tést\nconsole.log(buf1.toString());\n\n// Prints: this is a tC)st\nconsole.log(buf1.toString(&#39;ascii&#39;));\n\n\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from(&#39;7468697320697320612074c3a97374&#39;, &#39;hex&#39;);\n\n// Prints: this is a tést\nconsole.log(buf2.toString());\n\nA TypeError will be thrown if str is not a string.\nClass Method: Buffer.isBuffer(obj)\n\n\nobj {Object}\nReturn: {Boolean}\n\nReturns true if obj is a Buffer, false otherwise.\nClass Method: Buffer.isEncoding(encoding)\n\n\nencoding {String} A character encoding name to check\nReturn: {Boolean}\n\nReturns true if encoding contains a supported character encoding, or false\notherwise.\nClass Property: Buffer.poolSize\n\n\n{Integer} Default: 8192\n\nThis is the number of bytes used to determine the size of pre-allocated, internal\nBuffer instances used for pooling. This value may be modified.\nbuf[index]\n\nThe index operator [index] can be used to get and set the octet at position\nindex in buf. The values refer to individual bytes, so the legal value\nrange is between 0x00 and 0xFF (hex) or 0 and 255 (decimal).\nExample: Copy an ASCII string into a Buffer, one byte at a time\nconst str = &#39;Node.js&#39;;\nconst buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(str.length);\n\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; str.length ; i++) {\n  buf[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);\n}\n\n// Prints: Node.js\nconsole.log(buf.toString(&#39;ascii&#39;));\n\nbuf.compare(target[, targetStart[, targetEnd[, sourceStart[, sourceEnd]]]])\n\n\ntarget {Buffer} A Buffer to compare to\ntargetStart {Integer} The offset within target at which to begin\ncomparison. Default: 0\ntargetEnd {Integer} The offset with target at which to end comparison\n(not inclusive). Ignored when targetStart is undefined.\nDefault: target.length\nsourceStart {Integer} The offset within buf at which to begin comparison.\nIgnored when targetStart is undefined. Default: 0\nsourceEnd {Integer} The offset within buf at which to end comparison\n(not inclusive). Ignored when targetStart is undefined.\nDefault: buf.length\nReturn: {Integer}\n\nCompares buf with target and returns a number indicating whether buf\ncomes before, after, or is the same as target in sort order.\nComparison is based on the actual sequence of bytes in each Buffer.\n\n0 is returned if target is the same as buf\n1 is returned if target should come before buf when sorted.\n-1 is returned if target should come after buf when sorted.\n\nExamples:\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from(&#39;ABC&#39;);\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from(&#39;BCD&#39;);\nconst buf3 = Buffer.from(&#39;ABCD&#39;);\n\n// Prints: 0\nconsole.log(buf1.compare(buf1));\n\n// Prints: -1\nconsole.log(buf1.compare(buf2));\n\n// Prints: -1\nconsole.log(buf1.compare(buf3));\n\n// Prints: 1\nconsole.log(buf2.compare(buf1));\n\n// Prints: 1\nconsole.log(buf2.compare(buf3));\n\n// Prints: [ &lt;Buffer 41 42 43&gt;, &lt;Buffer 41 42 43 44&gt;, &lt;Buffer 42 43 44&gt; ]\n// (This result is equal to: [buf1, buf3, buf2])\nconsole.log([buf1, buf2, buf3].sort(Buffer.compare));\n\nThe optional targetStart, targetEnd, sourceStart, and sourceEnd\narguments can be used to limit the comparison to specific ranges within target\nand buf respectively.\nExamples:\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4]);\n\n// Prints: 0\nconsole.log(buf1.compare(buf2, 5, 9, 0, 4));\n\n// Prints: -1\nconsole.log(buf1.compare(buf2, 0, 6, 4));\n\n// Prints: 1\nconsole.log(buf1.compare(buf2, 5, 6, 5));\n\nA RangeError will be thrown if: targetStart &lt; 0, sourceStart &lt; 0,\ntargetEnd &gt; target.byteLength or sourceEnd &gt; source.byteLength.\nbuf.copy(target[, targetStart[, sourceStart[, sourceEnd]]])\n\n\ntarget {Buffer} A Buffer to copy into.\ntargetStart {Integer} The offset within target at which to begin\ncopying to. Default: 0\nsourceStart {Integer} The offset within buf at which to begin copying from.\nIgnored when targetStart is undefined. Default: 0\nsourceEnd {Integer} The offset within buf at which to stop copying (not\ninclusive). Ignored when sourceStart is undefined. Default: buf.length\nReturn: {Integer} The number of bytes copied.\n\nCopies data from a region of buf to a region in target even if the target\nmemory region overlaps with buf.\nExample: Create two Buffer instances, buf1 and buf2, and copy buf1 from\nbyte 16 through byte 19 into buf2, starting at the 8th byte in buf2\nconst buf1 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(26);\nconst buf2 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(26).fill(&#39;!&#39;);\n\nfor (let i = 0 ; i &lt; 26 ; i++) {\n  // 97 is the decimal ASCII value for &#39;a&#39;\n  buf1[i] = i + 97;\n}\n\nbuf1.copy(buf2, 8, 16, 20);\n\n// Prints: !!!!!!!!qrst!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nconsole.log(buf2.toString(&#39;ascii&#39;, 0, 25));\n\nExample: Create a single Buffer and copy data from one region to an\noverlapping region within the same Buffer\nconst buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(26);\n\nfor (var i = 0 ; i &lt; 26 ; i++) {\n  // 97 is the decimal ASCII value for &#39;a&#39;\n  buf[i] = i + 97;\n}\n\nbuf.copy(buf, 0, 4, 10);\n\n// Prints: efghijghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nconsole.log(buf.toString());\n\nbuf.entries()\n\n\nReturn: {Iterator}\n\nCreates and returns an iterator of [index, byte] pairs from the contents of\nbuf.\nExample: Log the entire contents of a Buffer\nconst buf = Buffer.from(&#39;buffer&#39;);\n\n// Prints:\n//   [0, 98]\n//   [1, 117]\n//   [2, 102]\n//   [3, 102]\n//   [4, 101]\n//   [5, 114]\nfor (var pair of buf.entries()) {\n  console.log(pair);\n}\n\nbuf.equals(otherBuffer)\n\n\notherBuffer {Buffer} A Buffer to compare to\nReturn: {Boolean}\n\nReturns true if both buf and otherBuffer have exactly the same bytes,\nfalse otherwise.\nExamples:\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from(&#39;ABC&#39;);\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from(&#39;414243&#39;, &#39;hex&#39;);\nconst buf3 = Buffer.from(&#39;ABCD&#39;);\n\n// Prints: true\nconsole.log(buf1.equals(buf2));\n\n// Prints: false\nconsole.log(buf1.equals(buf3));\n\nbuf.fill(value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])\n\n\nvalue {String | Buffer | Integer} The value to fill buf with\noffset {Integer} Where to start filling buf. Default: 0\nend {Integer} Where to stop filling buf (not inclusive). Default: buf.length\nencoding {String} If value is a string, this is its encoding.\nDefault: &#39;utf8&#39;\nReturn: {Buffer} A reference to buf\n\nFills buf with the specified value. If the offset and end are not given,\nthe entire buf will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to\nallow the creation and filling of a Buffer to be done on a single line.\nExample: Fill a Buffer with the ASCII character &#39;h&#39;\nconst b = Buffer.allocUnsafe(50).fill(&#39;h&#39;);\n\n// Prints: hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nconsole.log(b.toString());\n\nvalue is coerced to a uint32 value if it is not a String or Integer.\nIf the final write of a fill() operation falls on a multi-byte character,\nthen only the first bytes of that character that fit into buf are written.\nExample: Fill a Buffer with a two-byte character\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer c8 a2 c8&gt;\nconsole.log(Buffer.allocUnsafe(3).fill(&#39;\\u0222&#39;));\n\nbuf.indexOf(value[, byteOffset][, encoding])\n\n\nvalue {String | Buffer | Integer} What to search for\nbyteOffset {Integer} Where to begin searching in buf. Default: 0\nencoding {String} If value is a string, this is its encoding.\nDefault: &#39;utf8&#39;\nReturn: {Integer} The index of the first occurrence of value in buf or -1\nif buf does not contain value\n\nIf value is:\n\na string, value is interpreted according to the character encoding in\nencoding.\na Buffer, value will be used in its entirety. To compare a partial\nBuffer use buf.slice().\na number, value will be interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit integer\nvalue between 0 and 255.\n\nExamples:\nconst buf = Buffer.from(&#39;this is a buffer&#39;);\n\n// Prints: 0\nconsole.log(buf.indexOf(&#39;this&#39;)));\n\n// Prints: 2\nconsole.log(buf.indexOf(&#39;is&#39;));\n\n// Prints: 8\nconsole.log(buf.indexOf(Buffer.from(&#39;a buffer&#39;)));\n\n// Prints: 8\n// (97 is the decimal ASCII value for &#39;a&#39;)\nconsole.log(buf.indexOf(97));\n\n// Prints: -1\nconsole.log(buf.indexOf(Buffer.from(&#39;a buffer example&#39;)));\n\n// Prints: 8\nconsole.log(buf.indexOf(Buffer.from(&#39;a buffer example&#39;).slice(0, 8)));\n\n\nconst utf16Buffer = Buffer.from(&#39;\\u039a\\u0391\\u03a3\\u03a3\\u0395&#39;, &#39;ucs2&#39;);\n\n// Prints: 4\nconsole.log(utf16Buffer.indexOf(&#39;\\u03a3&#39;, 0, &#39;ucs2&#39;));\n\n// Prints: 6\nconsole.log(utf16Buffer.indexOf(&#39;\\u03a3&#39;, -4, &#39;ucs2&#39;));\n\nbuf.includes(value[, byteOffset][, encoding])\n\n\nvalue {String | Buffer | Integer} What to search for\nbyteOffset {Integer} Where to begin searching in buf.

Note that this\ndoes not necessarily reflect the amount of &quot;usable&quot; data within buf.\nExample: Create a Buffer and write a shorter ASCII string to it\nconst buf = Buffer.alloc(1234);\n\n// Prints: 1234\nconsole.log(buf.length);\n\nbuf.write(&#39;some string&#39;, 0, &#39;ascii&#39;);\n\n// Prints: 1234\nconsole.log(buf.length);\n\nWhile the length property is not immutable, changing the value of length\ncan result in undefined and inconsistent behavior. Applications that wish to\nmodify the length of a Buffer should therefore treat length as read-only and\nuse buf.slice() to create a new Buffer.\nExamples:\nvar buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);\n\nbuf.write(&#39;abcdefghj&#39;, 0, &#39;ascii&#39;);\n\n// Prints: 10\nconsole.log(buf.length);\n\nbuf = buf.slice(0, 5);\n\n// Prints: 5\nconsole.log(buf.length);\n\nbuf.readDoubleBE(offset[, noAssert])\nbuf.readDoubleLE(offset[, noAssert])\n\n\noffset {Integer} Where to start reading. Must satisfy: 0 &lt;= offset &lt;= buf.length - 8\nnoAssert {Boolean} Skip offset validation? Default: false\nReturn: {Number}\n\nReads a 64-bit double from buf at the specified offset with specified\nendian format (readDoubleBE() returns big endian, readDoubleLE() returns\nlittle endian).\nSetting noAssert to true allows offset to be beyond the end of buf, but\nthe result should be considered undefined behavior.\nExamples:\nconst buf = Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);\n\n// Prints: 8.20788039913184e-304\nconsole.log(buf.readDoubleBE());\n\n// Prints: 5.447603722011605e-270\nconsole.log(buf.readDoubleLE());\n\n// Throws an exception: RangeError: Index out of range\nconsole.log(buf.readDoubleLE(1));\n\n// Warning: reads passed end of buffer!\n// This will result in a segmentation fault!

This approach improves both performance and memory\nusage since v8 does not need to track and cleanup as many Persistent objects.\nIn the case where a developer may need to retain a small chunk of memory from a\npool for an indeterminate amount of time, it may be appropriate to create an\nun-pooled Buffer instance using SlowBuffer then copy out the relevant bits.\nExample:\n// Need to keep around a few small chunks of memory\nconst store = [];\n\nsocket.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  const data = socket.read();\n\n  // Allocate for retained data\n  const sb = SlowBuffer(10);\n\n  // Copy the data into the new allocation\n  data.copy(sb, 0, 0, 10);\n\n  store.push(sb);\n});\n\nUse of SlowBuffer should be used only as a last resort after a developer\nhas observed undue memory retention in their applications.\nnew SlowBuffer(size)\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow()`] instead.\n\nsize {Integer} The desired length of the new SlowBuffer\n\nAllocates a new SlowBuffer of size bytes. The size must be less than\nor equal to the value of buffer.kMaxLength. Otherwise, a RangeError is\nthrown. A zero-length Buffer will be created if size &lt;= 0.\nThe underlying memory for SlowBuffer instances is not initialized. The\ncontents of a newly created SlowBuffer are unknown and could contain\nsensitive data. Use buf.fill(0) to initialize a SlowBuffer to zeroes.\nExample:\nconst SlowBuffer = require(&#39;buffer&#39;).SlowBuffer;\n\nconst buf = new SlowBuffer(5);\n\n// Prints (contents may vary): &lt;Buffer 78 e0 82 02 01&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\nbuf.fill(0);\n\n// Prints: &lt;Buffer 00 00 00 00 00&gt;\nconsole.log(buf);\n\n"},"addons.html":{"url":"addons.html","title":"C/C++ Addons","body":"title: addons\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nAddons\nNode.js Addons are dynamically-linked shared objects, written in C or C++, that\ncan be loaded into Node.js using the require() function, and used\njust as if they were an ordinary Node.js module. They are used primarily to\nprovide an interface between JavaScript running in Node.js and C/C++ libraries.\nAt the moment, the method for implementing Addons is rather complicated,\ninvolving knowledge of several components and APIs :\n\nV8: the C++ library Node.js currently uses to provide the\nJavaScript implementation. V8 provides the mechanisms for creating objects,\ncalling functions, etc. V8&#39;s API is documented mostly in the\nv8.h header file (deps/v8/include/v8.h in the Node.js source\ntree), which is also available online.\n\nlibuv: The C library that implements the Node.js event loop, its worker\nthreads and all of the asynchronous behaviors of the platform. It also\nserves as a cross-platform abstraction library, giving easy, POSIX-like\naccess across all major operating systems to many common system tasks, such\nas interacting with the filesystem, sockets, timers and system events. libuv\nalso provides a pthreads-like threading abstraction that may be used to\npower more sophisticated asynchronous Addons that need to move beyond the\nstandard event loop. Addon authors are encouraged to think about how to\navoid blocking the event loop with I/O or other time-intensive tasks by\noff-loading work via libuv to non-blocking system operations, worker threads\nor a custom use of libuv&#39;s threads.\n\nInternal Node.js libraries. Node.js itself exports a number of C/C++ APIs\nthat Addons can use &mdash; the most important of which is the\nnode::ObjectWrap class.\n\nNode.js includes a number of other statically linked libraries including\nOpenSSL. These other libraries are located in the deps/ directory in the\nNode.js source tree. Only the V8 and OpenSSL symbols are purposefully\nre-exported by Node.js and may be used to various extents by Addons.\nSee Linking to Node.js&#39; own dependencies for additional information.\n\n\nAll of the following examples are available for download and may\nbe used as a starting-point for your own Addon.\nHello world\nThis &quot;Hello world&quot; example is a simple Addon, written in C++, that is the\nequivalent of the following JavaScript code:\nmodule.exports.hello = () =&gt; &#39;world&#39;;\n\nFirst, create the file hello.cc:\n// hello.cc\n#include &lt;node.h&gt;\n\nnamespace demo {\n\nusing v8::FunctionCallbackInfo;\nusing v8::Isolate;\nusing v8::Local;\nusing v8::Object;\nusing v8::String;\nusing v8::Value;\n\nvoid Method(const FunctionCallbackInfo&lt;Value&gt;&amp; args) {\n  Isolate* isolate = args.GetIsolate();\n  args.GetReturnValue().Set(String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, &quot;world&quot;));\n}\n\nvoid init(Local&lt;Object&gt; exports) {\n  NODE_SET_METHOD(exports, &quot;hello&quot;, Method);\n}\n\nNODE_MODULE(addon, init)\n\n}  // namespace demo\n\nNote that all Node.js Addons must export an initialization function following\nthe pattern:\nvoid Initialize(Local&lt;Object&gt; exports);\nNODE_MODULE(module_name, Initialize)\n\nThere is no semi-colon after NODE_MODULE as it&#39;s not a function (see\nnode.h).\nThe module_name must match the filename of the final binary (excluding\nthe .node suffix).\nIn the hello.cc example, then, the initialization function is init and the\nAddon module name is addon.\nBuilding\nOnce the source code has been written, it must be compiled into the binary\naddon.node file. To do so, create a file called binding.gyp in the\ntop-level of the project describing the build configuration of your module\nusing a JSON-like format. This file is used by node-gyp -- a tool written\nspecifically to compile Node.js Addons.\n{\n  &quot;targets&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;target_name&quot;: &quot;addon&quot;,\n      &quot;sources&quot;: [ &quot;hello.cc&quot; ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nNote: A version of the node-gyp utility is bundled and distributed with\nNode.js as part of npm. This version is not made directly available for\ndevelopers to use and is intended only to support the ability to use the\nnpm install command to compile and install Addons. Developers who wish to\nuse node-gyp directly can install it using the command\nnpm install -g node-gyp. See the node-gyp installation instructions for\nmore information, including platform-specific requirements.\nOnce the binding.gyp file has been created, use node-gyp configure to\ngenerate the appropriate project build files for the current platform. This\nwill generate either a Makefile (on Unix platforms) or a vcxproj file\n(on Windows) in the build/ directory.\nNext, invoke the node-gyp build command to generate the compiled addon.node\nfile. This will be put into the build/Release/ directory.\nWhen using npm install to install a Node.js Addon, npm uses its own bundled\nversion of node-gyp to perform this same set of actions, generating a\ncompiled version of the Addon for the user&#39;s platform on demand.\nOnce built, the binary Addon can be used from within Node.js by pointing\nrequire() to the built addon.node module:\n// hello.js\nconst addon = require(&#39;./build/Release/addon&#39;);\n\nconsole.log(addon.hello()); // &#39;world&#39;\n\nPlease see the examples below for further information or\nhttps://github.com/arturadib/node-qt for an example in production.\nBecause the exact path to the compiled Addon binary can vary depending on how\nit is compiled (i.e. sometimes it may be in ./build/Debug/), Addons can use\nthe bindings package to load the compiled module.\nNote that while the bindings package implementation is more sophisticated\nin how it locates Addon modules, it is essentially using a try-catch pattern\nsimilar to:\ntry {\n  return require(&#39;./build/Release/addon.node&#39;);\n} catch (err) {\n  return require(&#39;./build/Debug/addon.node&#39;);\n}\n\nLinking to Node.js&#39; own dependencies\nNode.js uses a number of statically linked libraries such as V8, libuv and\nOpenSSL. All Addons are required to link to V8 and may link to any of the\nother dependencies as well. Typically, this is as simple as including\nthe appropriate #include &lt;...&gt; statements (e.g. #include &lt;v8.h&gt;) and\nnode-gyp will locate the appropriate headers automatically. However, there\nare a few caveats to be aware of:\n\nWhen node-gyp runs, it will detect the specific release version of Node.js\nand download either the full source tarball or just the headers. If the full\nsource is downloaded, Addons will have complete access to the full set of\nNode.js dependencies. However, if only the Node.js headers are downloaded, then\nonly the symbols exported by Node.js will be available.\n\nnode-gyp can be run using the --nodedir flag pointing at a local Node.js\nsource image. Using this option, the Addon will have access to the full set of\ndependencies.\n\n\nLoading Addons using require()\nThe filename extension of the compiled Addon binary is .node (as opposed\nto .dll or .so). The require() function is written to look for\nfiles with the .node file extension and initialize those as dynamically-linked\nlibraries.\nWhen calling require(), the .node extension can usually be\nomitted and Node.js will still find and initialize the Addon. One caveat,\nhowever, is that Node.js will first attempt to locate and load modules or\nJavaScript files that happen to share the same base name. For instance, if\nthere is a file addon.js in the same directory as the binary addon.node,\nthen require(&#39;addon&#39;) will give precedence to the addon.js file\nand load it instead.\nNative Abstractions for Node.js\nEach of the examples illustrated in this document make direct use of the\nNode.js and V8 APIs for implementing Addons. It is important to understand\nthat the V8 API can, and has, changed dramatically from one V8 release to the\nnext (and one major Node.js release to the next). With each change, Addons may\nneed to be updated and recompiled in order to continue functioning. The Node.js\nrelease schedule is designed to minimize the frequency and impact of such\nchanges but there is little that Node.js can do currently to ensure stability\nof the V8 APIs.\nThe Native Abstractions for Node.js (or nan) provide a set of tools that\nAddon developers are recommended to use to keep compatibility between past and\nfuture releases of V8 and Node.js. See the nan examples for an\nillustration of how it can be used.\nAddon examples\nFollowing are some example Addons intended to help developers get started. The\nexamples make use of the V8 APIs. Refer to the online V8 reference\nfor help with the various V8 calls, and V8&#39;s Embedder&#39;s Guide for an\nexplanation of several concepts used such as handles, scopes, function\ntemplates, etc.\nEach of these examples using the following binding.gyp file:\n{\n  &quot;targets&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;target_name&quot;: &quot;addon&quot;,\n      &quot;sources&quot;: [ &quot;addon.cc&quot; ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nIn cases where there is more than one .cc file, simply add the additional\nfilename to the sources array. For example:\n&quot;sources&quot;: [&quot;addon.cc&quot;, &quot;myexample.cc&quot;]\n\nOnce the binding.gyp file is ready, the example Addons can be configured and\nbuilt using node-gyp:\n$ node-gyp configure build\n\nFunction arguments\nAddons will typically expose objects and functions that can be accessed from\nJavaScript running within Node.js. When functions are invoked from JavaScript,\nthe input arguments and return value must be mapped to and from the C/C++\ncode.\nThe following example illustrates how to read function arguments passed from\nJavaScript and how to return a result:\n// addon.cc\n#include &lt;node.h&gt;\n\nnamespace demo {\n\nusing v8::Exception;\nusing v8::FunctionCallbackInfo;\nusing v8::Isolate;\nusing v8::Local;\nusing v8::Number;\nusing v8::Object;\nusing v8::String;\nusing v8::Value;\n\n// This is the implementation of the &quot;add&quot; method\n// Input arguments are passed using the\n// const FunctionCallbackInfo&lt;Value&gt;&amp; args struct\nvoid Add(const FunctionCallbackInfo&lt;Value&gt;&amp; args) {\n  Isolate* isolate = args.GetIsolate();\n\n  // Check the number of arguments passed.\n  if (args.Length() &lt; 2) {\n    // Throw an Error that is passed back to JavaScript\n    isolate-&gt;ThrowException(Exception::TypeError(\n        String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, &quot;Wrong number of arguments&quot;)));\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Check the argument types\n  if (!args[0]-&gt;IsNumber() || !args[1]-&gt;IsNumber()) {\n    isolate-&gt;ThrowException(Exception::TypeError(\n        String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, &quot;Wrong arguments&quot;)));\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Perform the operation\n  double value = args[0]-&gt;NumberValue() + args[1]-&gt;NumberValue();\n  Local&lt;Number&gt; num = Number::New(isolate, value);\n\n  // Set the return value (using the passed in\n  // FunctionCallbackInfo&lt;Value&gt;&amp;)\n  args.GetReturnValue().Set(num);\n}\n\nvoid Init(Local&lt;Object&gt; exports) {\n  NODE_SET_METHOD(exports, &quot;add&quot;, Add);\n}\n\nNODE_MODULE(addon, Init)\n\n}  // namespace demo\n\nOnce compiled, the example Addon can be required and used from within Node.js:\n// test.js\nconst addon = require(&#39;./build/Release/addon&#39;);\n\nconsole.log(&#39;This should be eight:&#39;, addon.add(3, 5));\n\nCallbacks\nIt is common practice within Addons to pass JavaScript functions to a C++\nfunction and execute them from there. The following example illustrates how\nto invoke such callbacks:\n// addon.cc\n#include &lt;node.h&gt;\n\nnamespace demo {\n\nusing v8::Function;\nusing v8::FunctionCallbackInfo;\nusing v8::Isolate;\nusing v8::Local;\nusing v8::Null;\nusing v8::Object;\nusing v8::String;\nusing v8::Value;\n\nvoid RunCallback(const FunctionCallbackInfo&lt;Value&gt;&amp; args) {\n  Isolate* isolate = args.GetIsolate();\n  Local&lt;Function&gt; cb = Local&lt;Function&gt;::Cast(args[0]);\n  const unsigned argc = 1;\n  Local&lt;Value&gt; argv[argc] = { String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, &quot;hello world&quot;) };\n  cb-&gt;Call(Null(isolate), argc, argv);\n}\n\nvoid Init(Local&lt;Object&gt; exports, Local&lt;Object&gt; module) {\n  NODE_SET_METHOD(module, &quot;exports&quot;, RunCallback);\n}\n\nNODE_MODULE(addon, Init)\n\n}  // namespace demo\n\nNote that this example uses a two-argument form of Init() that receives\nthe full module object as the second argument. This allows the Addon\nto completely overwrite exports with a single function instead of\nadding the function as a property of exports.\nTo test it, run the following JavaScript:\n// test.js\nconst addon = require(&#39;./build/Release/addon&#39;);\n\naddon((msg) =&gt; {\n  console.log(msg); // &#39;hello world&#39;\n});\n\nNote that, in this example, the callback function is invoked synchronously.\nObject factory\nAddons can create and return new objects from within a C++ function as\nillustrated in the following example.

This capability\nis primarily provided by the child_process.spawn() function:\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\nconst ls = spawn(&#39;ls&#39;, [&#39;-lh&#39;, &#39;/usr&#39;]);\n\nls.stdout.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);\n});\n\nls.stderr.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`stderr: ${data}`);\n});\n\nls.on(&#39;close&#39;, (code) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);\n});\n\nBy default, pipes for stdin, stdout and stderr are established between\nthe parent Node.js process and the spawned child. It is possible to stream data\nthrough these pipes in a non-blocking way. Note, however, that some programs\nuse line-buffered I/O internally. While that does not affect Node.js, it can\nmean that data sent to the child process may not be immediately consumed.\nThe child_process.spawn() method spawns the child process asynchronously,\nwithout blocking the Node.js event loop. The child_process.spawnSync()\nfunction provides equivalent functionality in a synchronous manner that blocks\nthe event loop until the spawned process either exits or is terminated.\nFor convenience, the child_process module provides a handful of synchronous\nand asynchronous alternatives to child_process.spawn() and\nchild_process.spawnSync().  Note that each of these alternatives are\nimplemented on top of child_process.spawn() or child_process.spawnSync().\n\nchild_process.exec(): spawns a shell and runs a command within that shell,\npassing the stdout and stderr to a callback function when complete.\nchild_process.execFile(): similar to child_process.exec() except that\nit spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell.\nchild_process.fork(): spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a\nspecified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows\nsending messages between parent and child.\nchild_process.execSync(): a synchronous version of\nchild_process.exec() that will block the Node.js event loop.\nchild_process.execFileSync(): a synchronous version of\nchild_process.execFile() that will block the Node.js event loop.\n\nFor certain use cases, such as automating shell scripts, the\nsynchronous counterparts may be more convenient. In many cases, however,\nthe synchronous methods can have significant impact on performance due to\nstalling the event loop while spawned processes complete.\nAsynchronous Process Creation\nThe child_process.spawn(), child_process.fork(), child_process.exec(),\nand child_process.execFile() methods all follow the idiomatic asynchronous\nprogramming pattern typical of other Node.js APIs.\nEach of the methods returns a ChildProcess instance. These objects\nimplement the Node.js EventEmitter API, allowing the parent process to\nregister listener functions that are called when certain events occur during\nthe life cycle of the child process.\nThe child_process.exec() and child_process.execFile() methods additionally\nallow for an optional callback function to be specified that is invoked\nwhen the child process terminates.\nSpawning .bat and .cmd files on Windows\nThe importance of the distinction between child_process.exec() and\nchild_process.execFile() can vary based on platform. On Unix-type operating\nsystems (Unix, Linux, OSX) child_process.execFile() can be more efficient\nbecause it does not spawn a shell. On Windows, however, .bat and .cmd\nfiles are not executable on their own without a terminal, and therefore cannot\nbe launched using child_process.execFile(). When running on Windows, .bat\nand .cmd files can be invoked using child_process.spawn() with the shell\noption set, with child_process.exec(), or by spawning cmd.exe and passing\nthe .bat or .cmd file as an argument (which is what the shell option and\nchild_process.exec() do).\n// On Windows Only ...\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\nconst bat = spawn(&#39;cmd.exe&#39;, [&#39;/c&#39;, &#39;my.bat&#39;]);\n\nbat.stdout.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(data);\n});\n\nbat.stderr.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(data);\n});\n\nbat.on(&#39;exit&#39;, (code) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Child exited with code ${code}`);\n});\n\n// OR...\nconst exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec;\nexec(&#39;my.bat&#39;, (err, stdout, stderr) =&gt; {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n    return;\n  }\n  console.log(stdout);\n});\n\nchild_process.exec(command[, options][, callback])\n\n\ncommand {String} The command to run, with space-separated arguments\noptions {Object}\ncwd {String} Current working directory of the child process\nenv {Object} Environment key-value pairs\nencoding {String} (Default: &#39;utf8&#39;)\nshell {String} Shell to execute the command with\n(Default: &#39;/bin/sh&#39; on UNIX, &#39;cmd.exe&#39; on Windows, The shell should\n understand the -c switch on UNIX or /s /c on Windows.

Any exit code other than 0 is considered\nto be an error.\nThe stdout and stderr arguments passed to the callback will contain the\nstdout and stderr output of the child process. By default, Node.js will decode\nthe output as UTF-8 and pass strings to the callback. The encoding option\ncan be used to specify the character encoding used to decode the stdout and\nstderr output. If encoding is &#39;buffer&#39;, or an unrecognized character\nencoding, Buffer objects will be passed to the callback instead.\nThe options argument may be passed as the second argument to customize how\nthe process is spawned. The default options are:\n{\n  encoding: &#39;utf8&#39;,\n  timeout: 0,\n  maxBuffer: 200*1024,\n  killSignal: &#39;SIGTERM&#39;,\n  cwd: null,\n  env: null\n}\n\nIf timeout is greater than 0, the parent will send the the signal\nidentified by the killSignal property (the default is &#39;SIGTERM&#39;) if the\nchild runs longer than timeout milliseconds.\nNote: Unlike the exec(3) POSIX system call, child_process.exec() does not\nreplace the existing process and uses a shell to execute the command.\nchild_process.execFile(file[, args][, options][, callback])\n\n\nfile {String} The name or path of the executable file to run\nargs {Array} List of string arguments\noptions {Object}\ncwd {String} Current working directory of the child process\nenv {Object} Environment key-value pairs\nencoding {String} (Default: &#39;utf8&#39;)\ntimeout {Number} (Default: 0)\nmaxBuffer {Number} largest amount of data (in bytes) allowed on\nstdout or stderr - if exceeded child process is killed (Default: 200*1024)\nkillSignal {String} (Default: &#39;SIGTERM&#39;)\nuid {Number} Sets the user identity of the process.

(See setgid(2).)\n\n\ncallback {Function} called with the output when process terminates\nerror {Error}\nstdout {String|Buffer}\nstderr {String|Buffer}\n\n\nReturn: {ChildProcess}\n\nThe child_process.execFile() function is similar to child_process.exec()\nexcept that it does not spawn a shell. Rather, the specified executable file\nis spawned directly as a new process making it slightly more efficient than\nchild_process.exec().\nThe same options as child_process.exec() are supported. Since a shell is not\nspawned, behaviors such as I/O redirection and file globbing are not supported.\nconst execFile = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).execFile;\nconst child = execFile(&#39;node&#39;, [&#39;--version&#39;], (error, stdout, stderr) =&gt; {\n  if (error) {\n    throw error;\n  }\n  console.log(stdout);\n});\n\nThe stdout and stderr arguments passed to the callback will contain the\nstdout and stderr output of the child process. By default, Node.js will decode\nthe output as UTF-8 and pass strings to the callback. The encoding option\ncan be used to specify the character encoding used to decode the stdout and\nstderr output. If encoding is &#39;buffer&#39;, or an unrecognized character\nencoding, Buffer objects will be passed to the callback instead.\nchild_process.fork(modulePath[, args][, options])\n\n\nmodulePath {String} The module to run in the child\nargs {Array} List of string arguments\noptions {Object}\ncwd {String} Current working directory of the child process\nenv {Object} Environment key-value pairs\nexecPath {String} Executable used to create the child process\nexecArgv {Array} List of string arguments passed to the executable\n(Default: process.execArgv)\nsilent {Boolean} If true, stdin, stdout, and stderr of the child will be\npiped to the parent, otherwise they will be inherited from the parent, see\nthe &#39;pipe&#39; and &#39;inherit&#39; options for child_process.spawn()&#39;s\nstdio for more details (Default: false)\nstdio {Array} Supports the array version of child_process.spawn()&#39;s\nstdio option. When this option is provided, it overrides silent.\nuid {Number} Sets the user identity of the process. (See setuid(2).)\ngid {Number} Sets the group identity of the process. (See setgid(2).)\n\n\nReturn: {ChildProcess}\n\nThe child_process.fork() method is a special case of\nchild_process.spawn() used specifically to spawn new Node.js processes.\nLike child_process.spawn(), a ChildProcess object is returned. The returned\nChildProcess will have an additional communication channel built-in that\nallows messages to be passed back and forth between the parent and child. See\nchild.send() for details.\nIt is important to keep in mind that spawned Node.js child processes are\nindependent of the parent with exception of the IPC communication channel\nthat is established between the two. Each process has it&#39;s own memory, with\ntheir own V8 instances. Because of the additional resource allocations\nrequired, spawning a large number of child Node.js processes is not\nrecommended.\nBy default, child_process.fork() will spawn new Node.js instances using the\nprocess.execPath of the parent process. The execPath property in the\noptions object allows for an alternative execution path to be used.\nNode.js processes launched with a custom execPath will communicate with the\nparent process using the file descriptor (fd) identified using the\nenvironment variable NODE_CHANNEL_FD on the child process. The input and\noutput on this fd is expected to be line delimited JSON objects.\nNote: Unlike the fork(2) POSIX system call, child_process.fork() does\nnot clone the current process.\nchild_process.spawn(command[, args][, options])\n\n\ncommand {String} The command to run\nargs {Array} List of string arguments\noptions {Object}\ncwd {String} Current working directory of the child process\nenv {Object} Environment key-value pairs\nstdio {Array|String} Child&#39;s stdio configuration.

(See setgid(2).)\nshell {Boolean|String} If true, runs command inside of a shell. Uses\n&#39;/bin/sh&#39; on UNIX, and &#39;cmd.exe&#39; on Windows. A different shell can be\nspecified as a string. The shell should understand the -c switch on UNIX,\nor /s /c on Windows. Defaults to false (no shell).\n\n\nreturn: {ChildProcess}\n\nThe child_process.spawn() method spawns a new process using the given\ncommand, with command line arguments in args. If omitted, args defaults\nto an empty array.\nA third argument may be used to specify additional options, with these defaults:\n{\n  cwd: undefined,\n  env: process.env\n}\n\nUse cwd to specify the working directory from which the process is spawned.\nIf not given, the default is to inherit the current working directory.\nUse env to specify environment variables that will be visible to the new\nprocess, the default is process.env.\nExample of running ls -lh /usr, capturing stdout, stderr, and the\nexit code:\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\nconst ls = spawn(&#39;ls&#39;, [&#39;-lh&#39;, &#39;/usr&#39;]);\n\nls.stdout.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);\n});\n\nls.stderr.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`stderr: ${data}`);\n});\n\nls.on(&#39;close&#39;, (code) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);\n});\n\nExample: A very elaborate way to run ps ax | grep ssh\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\nconst ps = spawn(&#39;ps&#39;, [&#39;ax&#39;]);\nconst grep = spawn(&#39;grep&#39;, [&#39;ssh&#39;]);\n\nps.stdout.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  grep.stdin.write(data);\n});\n\nps.stderr.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`ps stderr: ${data}`);\n});\n\nps.on(&#39;close&#39;, (code) =&gt; {\n  if (code !== 0) {\n    console.log(`ps process exited with code ${code}`);\n  }\n  grep.stdin.end();\n});\n\ngrep.stdout.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`${data}`);\n});\n\ngrep.stderr.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`grep stderr: ${data}`);\n});\n\ngrep.on(&#39;close&#39;, (code) =&gt; {\n  if (code !== 0) {\n    console.log(`grep process exited with code ${code}`);\n  }\n});\n\nExample of checking for failed exec:\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\nconst child = spawn(&#39;bad_command&#39;);\n\nchild.on(&#39;error&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Failed to start child process.&#39;);\n});\n\noptions.detached\n\nOn Windows, setting options.detached to true makes it possible for the\nchild process to continue running after the parent exits. The child will have\nits own console window. Once enabled for a child process, it cannot be\ndisabled.\nOn non-Windows platforms, if options.detached is set to true, the child\nprocess will be made the leader of a new process group and session. Note that\nchild processes may continue running after the parent exits regardless of\nwhether they are detached or not.  See setsid(2) for more information.\nBy default, the parent will wait for the detached child to exit. To prevent\nthe parent from waiting for a given child, use the child.unref() method.\nDoing so will cause the parent&#39;s event loop to not include the child in its\nreference count, allowing the parent to exit independently of the child, unless\nthere is an established IPC channel between the child and parent.\nWhen using the detached option to start a long-running process, the process\nwill not stay running in the background after the parent exits unless it is\nprovided with a stdio configuration that is not connected to the parent.\nIf the parent&#39;s stdio is inherited, the child will remain attached to the\ncontrolling terminal.\nExample of a long-running process, by detaching and also ignoring its parent\nstdio file descriptors, in order to ignore the parent&#39;s termination:\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\n\nconst child = spawn(process.argv[0], [&#39;child_program.js&#39;], {\n  detached: true,\n  stdio: &#39;ignore&#39;\n});\n\nchild.unref();\n\nAlternatively one can redirect the child process&#39; output into files:\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\nconst out = fs.openSync(&#39;./out.log&#39;, &#39;a&#39;);\nconst err = fs.openSync(&#39;./out.log&#39;, &#39;a&#39;);\n\nconst child = spawn(&#39;prg&#39;, [], {\n detached: true,\n stdio: [ &#39;ignore&#39;, out, err ]\n});\n\nchild.unref();\n\noptions.stdio\n\nThe options.stdio option is used to configure the pipes that are established\nbetween the parent and child process. By default, the child&#39;s stdin, stdout,\nand stderr are redirected to corresponding child.stdin, child.stdout, and\nchild.stderr streams on the ChildProcess object. This is equivalent to\nsetting the options.stdio equal to [&#39;pipe&#39;, &#39;pipe&#39;, &#39;pipe&#39;].\nFor convenience, options.stdio may be one of the following strings:\n\n&#39;pipe&#39; - equivalent to [&#39;pipe&#39;, &#39;pipe&#39;, &#39;pipe&#39;] (the default)\n&#39;ignore&#39; - equivalent to [&#39;ignore&#39;, &#39;ignore&#39;, &#39;ignore&#39;]\n&#39;inherit&#39; - equivalent to [process.stdin, process.stdout, process.stderr]\n or [0,1,2]\n\nOtherwise, the value of options.stdio is an array where each index corresponds\nto an fd in the child. The fds 0, 1, and 2 correspond to stdin, stdout,\nand stderr, respectively. Additional fds can be specified to create additional\npipes between the parent and child. The value is one of the following:\n\n&#39;pipe&#39; - Create a pipe between the child process and the parent process.\nThe parent end of the pipe is exposed to the parent as a property on the\nchild_process object as child.stdio[fd]. Pipes created for\nfds 0 - 2 are also available as child.stdin, child.stdout\nand child.stderr, respectively.\n&#39;ipc&#39; - Create an IPC channel for passing messages/file descriptors\nbetween parent and child. A ChildProcess may have at most one IPC stdio\nfile descriptor. Setting this option enables the child.send() method.\nIf the child writes JSON messages to this file descriptor, the\nchild.on(&#39;message&#39;) event handler will be triggered in the parent.\nIf the child is a Node.js process, the presence of an IPC channel will enable\nprocess.send(), process.disconnect(), process.on(&#39;disconnect&#39;), and\nprocess.on(&#39;message&#39;) within the child.\n&#39;ignore&#39; - Instructs Node.js to ignore the fd in the child. While Node.js\nwill always open fds 0 - 2 for the processes it spawns, setting the fd to\n&#39;ignore&#39; will cause Node.js to open /dev/null and attach it to the\nchild&#39;s fd.\n{Stream} object - Share a readable or writable stream that refers to a tty,\nfile, socket, or a pipe with the child process. The stream&#39;s underlying\nfile descriptor is duplicated in the child process to the fd that\ncorresponds to the index in the stdio array. Note that the stream must\nhave an underlying descriptor (file streams do not until the &#39;open&#39;\nevent has occurred).\nPositive integer - The integer value is interpreted as a file descriptor\nthat is is currently open in the parent process. It is shared with the child\nprocess, similar to how {Stream} objects can be shared.\nnull, undefined - Use default value. For stdio fds 0, 1 and 2 (in other\nwords, stdin, stdout, and stderr) a pipe is created. For fd 3 and up, the\ndefault is &#39;ignore&#39;.\n\nExample:\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\n\n// Child will use parent&#39;s stdios\nspawn(&#39;prg&#39;, [], { stdio: &#39;inherit&#39; });\n\n// Spawn child sharing only stderr\nspawn(&#39;prg&#39;, [], { stdio: [&#39;pipe&#39;, &#39;pipe&#39;, process.stderr] });\n\n// Open an extra fd=4, to interact with programs presenting a\n// startd-style interface.\nspawn(&#39;prg&#39;, [], { stdio: [&#39;pipe&#39;, null, null, null, &#39;pipe&#39;] });\n\nIt is worth noting that when an IPC channel is established between the\nparent and child processes, and the child is a Node.js process, the child\nis launched with the IPC channel unreferenced (using unref()) until the\nchild registers an event handler for the process.on(&#39;disconnect&#39;) event.\nThis allows the child to exit normally without the process being held open\nby the open IPC channel.\nSee also: child_process.exec() and child_process.fork()\nSynchronous Process Creation\nThe child_process.spawnSync(), child_process.execSync(), and\nchild_process.execFileSync() methods are synchronous and WILL block\nthe Node.js event loop, pausing execution of any additional code until the\nspawned process exits.\nBlocking calls like these are mostly useful for simplifying general purpose\nscripting tasks and for simplifying the loading/processing of application\nconfiguration at startup.\nchild_process.execFileSync(file[, args][, options])\n\n\nfile {String} The name or path of the executable file to run\nargs {Array} List of string arguments\noptions {Object}\ncwd {String} Current working directory of the child process\ninput {String|Buffer} The value which will be passed as stdin to the\nspawned process\nsupplying this value will override stdio[0]\n\n\nstdio {Array} Child&#39;s stdio configuration.

Rather,\nuse the child_process.spawn(), child_process.exec(),\nchild_process.execFile(), or child_process.fork() methods to create\ninstances of ChildProcess.\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\n\ncode {Number} the exit code if the child exited on its own.\nsignal {String} the signal by which the child process was terminated.\n\nThe &#39;close&#39; event is emitted when the stdio streams of a child process have\nbeen closed. This is distinct from the &#39;exit&#39; event, since multiple\nprocesses might share the same stdio streams.\nEvent: &#39;disconnect&#39;\n\nThe &#39;disconnect&#39; event is emitted after calling the\nchild.disconnect() method in parent process or process.disconnect() in child process. After\ndisconnecting it is no longer possible to send or receive messages, and the\nchild.connected property is false.\nEvent: &#39;error&#39;\n\nerr {Error} the error.\n\nThe &#39;error&#39; event is emitted whenever:\n\nThe process could not be spawned, or\nThe process could not be killed, or\nSending a message to the child process failed.\n\nNote that the &#39;exit&#39; event may or may not fire after an error has occurred.\nIf you are listening to both the &#39;exit&#39; and &#39;error&#39; events, it is important\nto guard against accidentally invoking handler functions multiple times.\nSee also child.kill() and child.send().\nEvent: &#39;exit&#39;\n\n\ncode {Number} the exit code if the child exited on its own.\nsignal {String} the signal by which the child process was terminated.\n\nThe &#39;exit&#39; event is emitted after the child process ends. If the process\nexited, code is the final exit code of the process, otherwise null. If the\nprocess terminated due to receipt of a signal, signal is the string name of\nthe signal, otherwise null. One of the two will always be non-null.\nNote that when the &#39;exit&#39; event is triggered, child process stdio streams\nmight still be open.\nAlso, note that Node.js establishes signal handlers for SIGINT and\nSIGTERM and Node.js processes will not terminate immediately due to receipt\nof those signals. Rather, Node.js will perform a sequence of cleanup actions\nand then will re-raise the handled signal.\nSee waitpid(2).\nEvent: &#39;message&#39;\n\n\nmessage {Object} a parsed JSON object or primitive value.\nsendHandle {Handle} a net.Socket or net.Server object, or\nundefined.\n\nThe &#39;message&#39; event is triggered when a child process uses process.send()\nto send messages.\nchild.connected\n\n\n{Boolean} Set to false after child.disconnect() is called\n\nThe child.connected property indicates whether it is still possible to send\nand receive messages from a child process. When child.connected is false, it\nis no longer possible to send or receive messages.\nchild.disconnect()\n\nCloses the IPC channel between parent and child, allowing the child to exit\ngracefully once there are no other connections keeping it alive. After calling\nthis method the child.connected and process.connected properties in both\nthe parent and child (respectively) will be set to false, and it will be no\nlonger possible to pass messages between the processes.\nThe &#39;disconnect&#39; event will be emitted when there are no messages in the\nprocess of being received. This will most often be triggered immediately after\ncalling child.disconnect().\nNote that when the child process is a Node.js instance (e.g. spawned using\nchild_process.fork()), the process.disconnect() method can be invoked\nwithin the child process to close the IPC channel as well.\nchild.kill([signal])\n\n\nsignal {String}\n\nThe child.kill() methods sends a signal to the child process. If no argument\nis given, the process will be sent the &#39;SIGTERM&#39; signal. See signal(7) for\na list of available signals.\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\nconst grep = spawn(&#39;grep&#39;, [&#39;ssh&#39;]);\n\ngrep.on(&#39;close&#39;, (code, signal) =&gt; {\n  console.log(\n    `child process terminated due to receipt of signal ${signal}`);\n});\n\n// Send SIGHUP to process\ngrep.kill(&#39;SIGHUP&#39;);\n\nThe ChildProcess object may emit an &#39;error&#39; event if the signal cannot be\ndelivered. Sending a signal to a child process that has already exited is not\nan error but may have unforeseen consequences. Specifically, if the process\nidentifier (PID) has been reassigned to another process, the signal will be\ndelivered to that process instead which can have unexpected results.\nNote that while the function is called kill, the signal delivered to the\nchild process may not actually terminate the process.\nSee kill(2) for reference.\nAlso note: on Linux, child processes of child processes will not be terminated\nwhen attempting to kill their parent. This is likely to happen when running a\nnew process in a shell or with use of the shell option of ChildProcess, such\nas in this example:\n&#39;use strict&#39;;\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\n\nlet child = spawn(&#39;sh&#39;, [&#39;-c&#39;,\n  `node -e &quot;setInterval(() =&gt; {\n      console.log(process.pid, &#39;is alive&#39;)\n    }, 500);&quot;`\n  ], {\n    stdio: [&#39;inherit&#39;, &#39;inherit&#39;, &#39;inherit&#39;]\n  });\n\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  child.kill(); // does not terminate the node process in the shell\n}, 2000);\n\nchild.pid\n\n\n{Number} Integer\n\nReturns the process identifier (PID) of the child process.\nExample:\nconst spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;\nconst grep = spawn(&#39;grep&#39;, [&#39;ssh&#39;]);\n\nconsole.log(`Spawned child pid: ${grep.pid}`);\ngrep.stdin.end();\n\nchild.send(message[, sendHandle[, options]][, callback])\n\n\nmessage {Object}\nsendHandle {Handle}\noptions {Object}\ncallback {Function}\nReturn: {Boolean}\n\nWhen an IPC channel has been established between the parent and child (\ni.e. when using child_process.fork()), the child.send() method can be\nused to send messages to the child process. When the child process is a Node.js\ninstance, these messages can be received via the process.on(&#39;message&#39;) event.\nFor example, in the parent script:\nconst cp = require(&#39;child_process&#39;);\nconst n = cp.fork(`${__dirname}/sub.js`);\n\nn.on(&#39;message&#39;, (m) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;PARENT got message:&#39;, m);\n});\n\nn.send({ hello: &#39;world&#39; });\n\nAnd then the child script, &#39;sub.js&#39; might look like this:\nprocess.on(&#39;message&#39;, (m) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;CHILD got message:&#39;, m);\n});\n\nprocess.send({ foo: &#39;bar&#39; });\n\nChild Node.js processes will have a process.send() method of their own that\nallows the child to send messages back to the parent.\nThere is a special case when sending a {cmd: &#39;NODE_foo&#39;} message. All messages\ncontaining a NODE_ prefix in its cmd property are considered to be reserved\nfor use within Node.js core and will not be emitted in the child&#39;s\nprocess.on(&#39;message&#39;) event. Rather, such messages are emitted using the\nprocess.on(&#39;internalMessage&#39;) event and are consumed internally by Node.js.\nApplications should avoid using such messages or listening for\n&#39;internalMessage&#39; events as it is subject to change without notice.\nThe optional sendHandle argument that may be passed to child.send() is for\npassing a TCP server or socket object to the child process. The child will\nreceive the object as the second argument passed to the callback function\nregistered on the process.on(&#39;message&#39;) event. Any data that is received\nand buffered in the socket will not be sent to the child.\nThe options argument, if present, is an object used to parameterize the\nsending of certain types of handles. options supports the following\nproperties:\n\nkeepOpen - A Boolean value that can be used when passing instances of\nnet.Socket. When true, the socket is kept open in the sending process.\nDefaults to false.\n\nThe optional callback is a function that is invoked after the message is\nsent but before the child may have received it.  The function is called with a\nsingle argument: null on success, or an Error object on failure.\nIf no callback function is provided and the message cannot be sent, an\n&#39;error&#39; event will be emitted by the ChildProcess object. This can happen,\nfor instance, when the child process has already exited.\nchild.send() will return false if the channel has closed or when the\nbacklog of unsent messages exceeds a threshold that makes it unwise to send\nmore. Otherwise, the method returns true. The callback function can be\nused to implement flow control.\nExample: sending a server object\nThe sendHandle argument can be used, for instance, to pass the handle of\na TCP server object to the child process as illustrated in the example below:\nconst child = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).fork(&#39;child.js&#39;);\n\n// Open up the server object and send the handle.\nconst server = require(&#39;net&#39;).createServer();\nserver.on(&#39;connection&#39;, (socket) =&gt; {\n  socket.end(&#39;handled by parent&#39;);\n});\nserver.listen(1337, () =&gt; {\n  child.send(&#39;server&#39;, server);\n});\n\nThe child would then receive the server object as:\nprocess.on(&#39;message&#39;, (m, server) =&gt; {\n  if (m === &#39;server&#39;) {\n    server.on(&#39;connection&#39;, (socket) =&gt; {\n      socket.end(&#39;handled by child&#39;);\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nOnce the server is now shared between the parent and child, some connections\ncan be handled by the parent and some by the child.\nWhile the example above uses a server created using the net module, dgram\nmodule servers use exactly the same workflow with the exceptions of listening on\na &#39;message&#39; event instead of &#39;connection&#39; and using server.bind() instead of\nserver.listen(). This is, however, currently only supported on UNIX platforms.\nExample: sending a socket object\nSimilarly, the sendHandler argument can be used to pass the handle of a\nsocket to the child process. The example below spawns two children that each\nhandle connections with &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;special&quot; priority:\nconst normal = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).fork(&#39;child.js&#39;, [&#39;normal&#39;]);\nconst special = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).fork(&#39;child.js&#39;, [&#39;special&#39;]);\n\n// Open up the server and send sockets to child\nconst server = require(&#39;net&#39;).createServer();\nserver.on(&#39;connection&#39;, (socket) =&gt; {\n\n  // If this is special priority\n  if (socket.remoteAddress === &#39;74.125.127.100&#39;) {\n    special.send(&#39;socket&#39;, socket);\n    return;\n  }\n  // This is normal priority\n  normal.send(&#39;socket&#39;, socket);\n});\nserver.listen(1337);\n\nThe child.js would receive the socket handle as the second argument passed\nto the event callback function:\nprocess.on(&#39;message&#39;, (m, socket) =&gt; {\n  if (m === &#39;socket&#39;) {\n    socket.end(`Request handled with ${process.argv[2]} priority`);\n  }\n});\n\nOnce a socket has been passed to a child, the parent is no longer capable of\ntracking when the socket is destroyed. To indicate this, the .connections\nproperty becomes null. It is recommended not to use .maxConnections when\nthis occurs.\nNote: this function uses JSON.stringify() internally to serialize the\nmessage.\nchild.stderr\n\n\n{Stream}\n\nA Readable Stream that represents the child process&#39;s stderr.\nIf the child was spawned with stdio[2] set to anything other than &#39;pipe&#39;,\nthen this will be undefined.\nchild.stderr is an alias for child.stdio[2]. Both properties will refer to\nthe same value.\nchild.stdin\n\n\n{Stream}\n\nA Writable Stream that represents the child process&#39;s stdin.\nNote that if a child process waits to read all of its input, the child will not\ncontinue until this stream has been closed via end().\nIf the child was spawned with stdio[0] set to anything other than &#39;pipe&#39;,\nthen this will be undefined.\nchild.stdin is an alias for child.stdio[0]. Both properties will refer to\nthe same value.\nchild.stdio\n\n\n{Array}\n\nA sparse array of pipes to the child process, corresponding with positions in\nthe stdio option passed to child_process.spawn() that have been set\nto the value &#39;pipe&#39;. Note that child.stdio[0], child.stdio[1], and\nchild.stdio[2] are also available as child.stdin, child.stdout, and\nchild.stderr, respectively.\nIn the following example, only the child&#39;s fd 1 (stdout) is configured as a\npipe, so only the parent&#39;s child.stdio[1] is a stream, all other values in\nthe array are null.\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nconst child_process = require(&#39;child_process&#39;);\n\nconst child = child_process.spawn(&#39;ls&#39;, {\n    stdio: [\n      0, // Use parents stdin for child\n      &#39;pipe&#39;, // Pipe child&#39;s stdout to parent\n      fs.openSync(&#39;err.out&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) // Direct child&#39;s stderr to a file\n    ]\n});\n\nassert.equal(child.stdio[0], null);\nassert.equal(child.stdio[0], child.stdin);\n\nassert(child.stdout);\nassert.equal(child.stdio[1], child.stdout);\n\nassert.equal(child.stdio[2], null);\nassert.equal(child.stdio[2], child.stderr);\n\nchild.stdout\n\n\n{Stream}\n\nA Readable Stream that represents the child process&#39;s stdout.\nIf the child was spawned with stdio[1] set to anything other than &#39;pipe&#39;,\nthen this will be undefined.\nchild.stdout is an alias for child.stdio[1]. Both properties will refer\nto the same value.\nmaxBuffer and Unicode\nIt is important to keep in mind that the maxBuffer option specifies the\nlargest number of octets allowed on stdout or stderr. If this value is\nexceeded, then the child process is terminated. This particularly impacts\noutput that includes multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8 or UTF-16.\nFor instance, the following will output 13 UTF-8 encoded octets to stdout\nalthough there are only 4 characters:\nconsole.log(&#39;中文测试&#39;);\n\n"},"cluster.html":{"url":"cluster.html","title":"Cluster","body":"title: cluster\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nCluster\nStability: 2 - Stable\nA single instance of Node.js runs in a single thread. To take advantage of\nmulti-core systems the user will sometimes want to launch a cluster of Node.js\nprocesses to handle the load.\nThe cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that\nall share server ports.\nconst cluster = require(&#39;cluster&#39;);\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\nconst numCPUs = require(&#39;os&#39;).cpus().length;\n\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\n  // Fork workers.\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; numCPUs; i++) {\n    cluster.fork();\n  }\n\n  cluster.on(&#39;exit&#39;, (worker, code, signal) =&gt; {\n    console.log(`worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);\n  });\n} else {\n  // Workers can share any TCP connection\n  // In this case it is an HTTP server\n  http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    res.end(&#39;hello world\\n&#39;);\n  }).listen(8000);\n}\n\nRunning Node.js will now share port 8000 between the workers:\n$ NODE_DEBUG=cluster node server.js\n23521,Master Worker 23524 online\n23521,Master Worker 23526 online\n23521,Master Worker 23523 online\n23521,Master Worker 23528 online\n\nPlease note that, on Windows, it is not yet possible to set up a named pipe\nserver in a worker.\nHow It Works\n\nThe worker processes are spawned using the child_process.fork() method,\nso that they can communicate with the parent via IPC and pass server\nhandles back and forth.\nThe cluster module supports two methods of distributing incoming\nconnections.\nThe first one (and the default one on all platforms except Windows),\nis the round-robin approach, where the master process listens on a\nport, accepts new connections and distributes them across the workers\nin a round-robin fashion, with some built-in smarts to avoid\noverloading a worker process.\nThe second approach is where the master process creates the listen\nsocket and sends it to interested workers. The workers then accept\nincoming connections directly.\nThe second approach should, in theory, give the best performance.\nIn practice however, distribution tends to be very unbalanced due\nto operating system scheduler vagaries. Loads have been observed\nwhere over 70% of all connections ended up in just two processes,\nout of a total of eight.\nBecause server.listen() hands off most of the work to the master\nprocess, there are three cases where the behavior between a normal\nNode.js process and a cluster worker differs:\n\nserver.listen({fd: 7}) Because the message is passed to the master,\nfile descriptor 7 in the parent will be listened on, and the\nhandle passed to the worker, rather than listening to the worker&#39;s\nidea of what the number 7 file descriptor references.\nserver.listen(handle) Listening on handles explicitly will cause\nthe worker to use the supplied handle, rather than talk to the master\nprocess.  If the worker already has the handle, then it&#39;s presumed\nthat you know what you are doing.\nserver.listen(0) Normally, this will cause servers to listen on a\nrandom port.  However, in a cluster, each worker will receive the\nsame &quot;random&quot; port each time they do listen(0).  In essence, the\nport is random the first time, but predictable thereafter.  If you\nwant to listen on a unique port, generate a port number based on the\ncluster worker ID.\n\nThere is no routing logic in Node.js, or in your program, and no shared\nstate between the workers.  Therefore, it is important to design your\nprogram such that it does not rely too heavily on in-memory data objects\nfor things like sessions and login.\nBecause workers are all separate processes, they can be killed or\nre-spawned depending on your program&#39;s needs, without affecting other\nworkers.  As long as there are some workers still alive, the server will\ncontinue to accept connections.  If no workers are alive, existing connections\nwill be dropped and new connections will be refused.  Node.js does not\nautomatically manage the number of workers for you, however.  It is your\nresponsibility to manage the worker pool for your application&#39;s needs.\nClass: Worker\nA Worker object contains all public information and method about a worker.\nIn the master it can be obtained using cluster.workers. In a worker\nit can be obtained using cluster.worker.\nEvent: &#39;disconnect&#39;\nSimilar to the cluster.on(&#39;disconnect&#39;) event, but specific to this worker.\ncluster.fork().on(&#39;disconnect&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  // Worker has disconnected\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;error&#39;\nThis event is the same as the one provided by child_process.fork().\nIn a worker you can also use process.on(&#39;error&#39;).\nEvent: &#39;exit&#39;\n\ncode {Number} the exit code, if it exited normally.\nsignal {String} the name of the signal (eg. &#39;SIGHUP&#39;) that caused\nthe process to be killed.\n\nSimilar to the cluster.on(&#39;exit&#39;) event, but specific to this worker.\nconst worker = cluster.fork();\nworker.on(&#39;exit&#39;, (code, signal) =&gt; {\n  if (signal) {\n    console.log(`worker was killed by signal: ${signal}`);\n  } else if (code !== 0) {\n    console.log(`worker exited with error code: ${code}`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(&#39;worker success!&#39;);\n  }\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;listening&#39;\n\naddress {Object}\n\nSimilar to the cluster.on(&#39;listening&#39;) event, but specific to this worker.\ncluster.fork().on(&#39;listening&#39;, (address) =&gt; {\n  // Worker is listening\n});\n\nIt is not emitted in the worker.\nEvent: &#39;message&#39;\n\nmessage {Object}\nhandle {undefined|Object}\n\nSimilar to the cluster.on(&#39;message&#39;) event, but specific to this worker.

Existing\nconnections will be allowed to close as usual. When no more connections exist,\nsee server.close(), the IPC channel to the worker will close allowing it to\ndie gracefully.\nThe above applies only to server connections, client connections are not\nautomatically closed by workers, and disconnect does not wait for them to close\nbefore exiting.\nNote that in a worker, process.disconnect exists, but it is not this function,\nit is disconnect.\nBecause long living server connections may block workers from disconnecting, it\nmay be useful to send a message, so application specific actions may be taken to\nclose them.

Danger!`);\n  // Prints: Danger Will Robinson! Danger!, to stderr\n\nExample using the Console class:\nconst out = getStreamSomehow();\nconst err = getStreamSomehow();\nconst myConsole = new console.Console(out, err);\n\nmyConsole.log(&#39;hello world&#39;);\n  // Prints: hello world, to out\nmyConsole.log(&#39;hello %s&#39;, &#39;world&#39;);\n  // Prints: hello world, to out\nmyConsole.error(new Error(&#39;Whoops, something bad happened&#39;));\n  // Prints: [Error: Whoops, something bad happened], to err\n\nconst name = &#39;Will Robinson&#39;;\nmyConsole.warn(`Danger ${name}! Danger!`);\n  // Prints: Danger Will Robinson! Danger!, to err\n\nWhile the API for the Console class is designed fundamentally around the\nbrowser console object, the Console in Node.js is not intended to\nduplicate the browser&#39;s functionality exactly.\nAsynchronous vs Synchronous Consoles\nThe console functions are usually asynchronous unless the destination is a file.\nDisks are fast and operating systems normally employ write-back caching;\nit should be a very rare occurrence indeed that a write blocks, but it\nis possible.\nAdditionally, console functions are blocking when outputting to TTYs\n(terminals) on OS X as a workaround for the OS&#39;s very small, 1kb buffer size.\nThis is to prevent interleaving between stdout and stderr.\nClass: Console\n\nThe Console class can be used to create a simple logger with configurable\noutput streams and can be accessed using either require(&#39;console&#39;).Console\nor console.Console:\nconst Console = require(&#39;console&#39;).Console;\nconst Console = console.Console;\n\nnew Console(stdout[, stderr])\nCreates a new Console by passing one or two writable stream instances.\nstdout is a writable stream to print log or info output. stderr\nis used for warning or error output. If stderr isn&#39;t passed, warning and error\noutput will be sent to stdout.\nconst output = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;./stdout.log&#39;);\nconst errorOutput = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;./stderr.log&#39;);\n// custom simple logger\nconst logger = new Console(output, errorOutput);\n// use it like console\nvar count = 5;\nlogger.log(&#39;count: %d&#39;, count);\n// in stdout.log: count 5\n\nThe global console is a special Console whose output is sent to\nprocess.stdout and process.stderr. It is equivalent to calling:\nnew Console(process.stdout, process.stderr);\n\nconsole.assert(value[, message][, ...])\n\nA simple assertion test that verifies whether value is truthy. If it is not,\nan AssertionError is thrown. If provided, the error message is formatted\nusing util.format() and used as the error message.\nconsole.assert(true, &#39;does nothing&#39;);\n  // OK\nconsole.assert(false, &#39;Whoops %s&#39;, &#39;didn\\&#39;t work&#39;);\n  // AssertionError: Whoops didn&#39;t work\n\nNote: the console.assert() method is implemented differently in Node.js\nthan the console.assert() method available in browsers.\nSpecifically, in browsers, calling console.assert() with a falsy\nassertion will cause the message to be printed to the console without\ninterrupting execution of subsequent code. In Node.js, however, a falsy\nassertion will cause an AssertionError to be thrown.\nFunctionality approximating that implemented by browsers can be implemented\nby extending Node.js&#39; console and overriding the console.assert() method.\nIn the following example, a simple module is created that extends and overrides\nthe default behavior of console in Node.js.\n&#39;use strict&#39;;\n\n// Creates a simple extension of console with a\n// new impl for assert without monkey-patching.\nconst myConsole = Object.setPrototypeOf({\n  assert(assertion, message, ...args) {\n    try {\n      console.assert(assertion, message, ...args);\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error(err.stack);\n    }\n  }\n}, console);\n\nmodule.exports = myConsole;\n\nThis can then be used as a direct replacement for the built in console:\nconst console = require(&#39;./myConsole&#39;);\nconsole.assert(false, &#39;this message will print, but no error thrown&#39;);\nconsole.log(&#39;this will also print&#39;);\n\nconsole.dir(obj[, options])\n\nUses util.inspect() on obj and prints the resulting string to stdout.\nThis function bypasses any custom inspect() function defined on obj. An\noptional options object may be passed to alter certain aspects of the\nformatted string:\n\nshowHidden - if true then the object&#39;s non-enumerable and symbol\nproperties will be shown too. Defaults to false.\n\ndepth - tells util.inspect() how many times to recurse while\nformatting the object. This is useful for inspecting large complicated objects.\nDefaults to 2. To make it recurse indefinitely, pass null.\n\ncolors - if true, then the output will be styled with ANSI color codes.\nDefaults to false. Colors are customizable; see\ncustomizing util.inspect() colors.\n\n\nconsole.error([data][, ...])\n\nPrints to stderr with newline. Multiple arguments can be passed, with the\nfirst used as the primary message and all additional used as substitution\nvalues similar to printf(3) (the arguments are all passed to\nutil.format()).\nconst code = 5;\nconsole.error(&#39;error #%d&#39;, code);\n  // Prints: error #5, to stderr\nconsole.error(&#39;error&#39;, code);\n  // Prints: error 5, to stderr\n\nIf formatting elements (e.g. %d) are not found in the first string then\nutil.inspect() is called on each argument and the resulting string\nvalues are concatenated. See util.format() for more information.\nconsole.info([data][, ...])\n\nThe console.info() function is an alias for console.log().\nconsole.log([data][, ...])\n\nPrints to stdout with newline. Multiple arguments can be passed, with the\nfirst used as the primary message and all additional used as substitution\nvalues similar to printf(3) (the arguments are all passed to\nutil.format()).\nvar count = 5;\nconsole.log(&#39;count: %d&#39;, count);\n  // Prints: count: 5, to stdout\nconsole.log(&#39;count:&#39;, count);\n  // Prints: count: 5, to stdout\n\nIf formatting elements (e.g. %d) are not found in the first string then\nutil.inspect() is called on each argument and the resulting string\nvalues are concatenated. See util.format() for more information.\nconsole.time(label)\n\nStarts a timer that can be used to compute the duration of an operation. Timers\nare identified by a unique label. Use the same label when you call\nconsole.timeEnd() to stop the timer and output the elapsed time in\nmilliseconds to stdout. Timer durations are accurate to the sub-millisecond.\nconsole.timeEnd(label)\n\nStops a timer that was previously started by calling console.time() and\nprints the result to stdout:\nconsole.time(&#39;100-elements&#39;);\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {\n  ;\n}\nconsole.timeEnd(&#39;100-elements&#39;);\n// prints 100-elements: 225.438ms\n\nNote: As of Node.js v6.0.0, console.timeEnd() deletes the timer to avoid\nleaking it. On older versions, the timer persisted. This allowed\nconsole.timeEnd() to be called multiple times for the same label. This\nfunctionality was unintended and is no longer supported.\nconsole.trace(message[, ...])\n\nPrints to stderr the string &#39;Trace :&#39;, followed by the util.format()\nformatted message and stack trace to the current position in the code.\nconsole.trace(&#39;Show me&#39;);\n  // Prints: (stack trace will vary based on where trace is called)\n  //  Trace: Show me\n  //    at repl:2:9\n  //    at REPLServer.defaultEval (repl.js:248:27)\n  //    at bound (domain.js:287:14)\n  //    at REPLServer.runBound [as eval] (domain.js:300:12)\n  //    at REPLServer.&lt;anonymous&gt; (repl.js:412:12)\n  //    at emitOne (events.js:82:20)\n  //    at REPLServer.emit (events.js:169:7)\n  //    at REPLServer.Interface._onLine (readline.js:210:10)\n  //    at REPLServer.Interface._line (readline.js:549:8)\n  //    at REPLServer.Interface._ttyWrite (readline.js:826:14)\n\nconsole.warn([data][, ...])\n\nThe console.warn() function is an alias for console.error().\n"},"crypto.html":{"url":"crypto.html","title":"Crypto","body":"title: crypto\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nCrypto\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe crypto module provides cryptographic functionality that includes a set of\nwrappers for OpenSSL&#39;s hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign and verify functions.\nUse require(&#39;crypto&#39;) to access this module.\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\n\nconst secret = &#39;abcdefg&#39;;\nconst hash = crypto.createHmac(&#39;sha256&#39;, secret)\n                   .update(&#39;I love cupcakes&#39;)\n                   .digest(&#39;hex&#39;);\nconsole.log(hash);\n  // Prints:\n  //   c0fa1bc00531bd78ef38c628449c5102aeabd49b5dc3a2a516ea6ea959d6658e\n\nDetermining if crypto support is unavailable\nIt is possible for Node.js to be built without including support for the\ncrypto module.

Cipher objects are not to be created\ndirectly using the new keyword.\nExample: Using Cipher objects as streams:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst cipher = crypto.createCipher(&#39;aes192&#39;, &#39;a password&#39;);\n\nvar encrypted = &#39;&#39;;\ncipher.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  var data = cipher.read();\n  if (data)\n    encrypted += data.toString(&#39;hex&#39;);\n});\ncipher.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(encrypted);\n  // Prints: ca981be48e90867604588e75d04feabb63cc007a8f8ad89b10616ed84d815504\n});\n\ncipher.write(&#39;some clear text data&#39;);\ncipher.end();\n\nExample: Using Cipher and piped streams:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nconst cipher = crypto.createCipher(&#39;aes192&#39;, &#39;a password&#39;);\n\nconst input = fs.createReadStream(&#39;test.js&#39;);\nconst output = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;test.enc&#39;);\n\ninput.pipe(cipher).pipe(output);\n\nExample: Using the cipher.update() and cipher.final() methods:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst cipher = crypto.createCipher(&#39;aes192&#39;, &#39;a password&#39;);\n\nvar encrypted = cipher.update(&#39;some clear text data&#39;, &#39;utf8&#39;, &#39;hex&#39;);\nencrypted += cipher.final(&#39;hex&#39;);\nconsole.log(encrypted);\n  // Prints: ca981be48e90867604588e75d04feabb63cc007a8f8ad89b10616ed84d815504\n\ncipher.final([output_encoding])\nReturns any remaining enciphered contents. If output_encoding\nparameter is one of &#39;latin1&#39;, &#39;base64&#39; or &#39;hex&#39;, a string is returned.\nIf an output_encoding is not provided, a Buffer is returned.\nOnce the cipher.final() method has been called, the Cipher object can no\nlonger be used to encrypt data. Attempts to call cipher.final() more than\nonce will result in an error being thrown.\ncipher.setAAD(buffer)\nWhen using an authenticated encryption mode (only GCM is currently\nsupported), the cipher.setAAD() method sets the value used for the\nadditional authenticated data (AAD) input parameter.\ncipher.getAuthTag()\nWhen using an authenticated encryption mode (only GCM is currently\nsupported), the cipher.getAuthTag() method returns a Buffer containing\nthe authentication tag that has been computed from the given data.\nThe cipher.getAuthTag() method should only be called after encryption has\nbeen completed using the cipher.final() method.\ncipher.setAutoPadding(auto_padding=true)\nWhen using block encryption algorithms, the Cipher class will automatically\nadd padding to the input data to the appropriate block size. To disable the\ndefault padding call cipher.setAutoPadding(false).\nWhen auto_padding is false, the length of the entire input data must be a\nmultiple of the cipher&#39;s block size or cipher.final() will throw an Error.\nDisabling automatic padding is useful for non-standard padding, for instance\nusing 0x0 instead of PKCS padding.\nThe cipher.setAutoPadding() method must be called before cipher.final().\ncipher.update(data[, input_encoding][, output_encoding])\nUpdates the cipher with data. If the input_encoding argument is given,\nit&#39;s value must be one of &#39;utf8&#39;, &#39;ascii&#39;, or &#39;latin1&#39; and the data\nargument is a string using the specified encoding. If the input_encoding\nargument is not given, data must be a Buffer. If data is a\nBuffer then input_encoding is ignored.\nThe output_encoding specifies the output format of the enciphered\ndata, and can be &#39;latin1&#39;, &#39;base64&#39; or &#39;hex&#39;. If the output_encoding\nis specified, a string using the specified encoding is returned. If no\noutput_encoding is provided, a Buffer is returned.\nThe cipher.update() method can be called multiple times with new data until\ncipher.final() is called. Calling cipher.update() after\ncipher.final() will result in an error being thrown.\nClass: Decipher\nInstances of the Decipher class are used to decrypt data. The class can be\nused in one of two ways:\n\nAs a stream that is both readable and writable, where plain encrypted\ndata is written to produce unencrypted data on the readable side, or\nUsing the decipher.update() and decipher.final() methods to\nproduce the unencrypted data.\n\nThe crypto.createDecipher() or crypto.createDecipheriv() methods are\nused to create Decipher instances. Decipher objects are not to be created\ndirectly using the new keyword.\nExample: Using Decipher objects as streams:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst decipher = crypto.createDecipher(&#39;aes192&#39;, &#39;a password&#39;);\n\nvar decrypted = &#39;&#39;;\ndecipher.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  var data = decipher.read();\n  if (data)\n    decrypted += data.toString(&#39;utf8&#39;);\n});\ndecipher.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(decrypted);\n  // Prints: some clear text data\n});\n\nvar encrypted = &#39;ca981be48e90867604588e75d04feabb63cc007a8f8ad89b10616ed84d815504&#39;;\ndecipher.write(encrypted, &#39;hex&#39;);\ndecipher.end();\n\nExample: Using Decipher and piped streams:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nconst decipher = crypto.createDecipher(&#39;aes192&#39;, &#39;a password&#39;);\n\nconst input = fs.createReadStream(&#39;test.enc&#39;);\nconst output = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;test.js&#39;);\n\ninput.pipe(decipher).pipe(output);\n\nExample: Using the decipher.update() and decipher.final() methods:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst decipher = crypto.createDecipher(&#39;aes192&#39;, &#39;a password&#39;);\n\nvar encrypted = &#39;ca981be48e90867604588e75d04feabb63cc007a8f8ad89b10616ed84d815504&#39;;\nvar decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, &#39;hex&#39;, &#39;utf8&#39;);\ndecrypted += decipher.final(&#39;utf8&#39;);\nconsole.log(decrypted);\n  // Prints: some clear text data\n\ndecipher.final([output_encoding])\nReturns any remaining deciphered contents. If output_encoding\nparameter is one of &#39;latin1&#39;, &#39;base64&#39; or &#39;hex&#39;, a string is returned.\nIf an output_encoding is not provided, a Buffer is returned.\nOnce the decipher.final() method has been called, the Decipher object can\nno longer be used to decrypt data. Attempts to call decipher.final() more\nthan once will result in an error being thrown.\ndecipher.setAAD(buffer)\nWhen using an authenticated encryption mode (only GCM is currently\nsupported), the cipher.setAAD() method sets the value used for the\nadditional authenticated data (AAD) input parameter.\ndecipher.setAuthTag(buffer)\nWhen using an authenticated encryption mode (only GCM is currently\nsupported), the decipher.setAuthTag() method is used to pass in the\nreceived authentication tag. If no tag is provided, or if the cipher text\nhas been tampered with, decipher.final() with throw, indicating that the\ncipher text should be discarded due to failed authentication.\ndecipher.setAutoPadding(auto_padding=true)\nWhen data has been encrypted without standard block padding, calling\ndecipher.setAutoPadding(false) will disable automatic padding to prevent\ndecipher.final() from checking for and removing padding.\nTurning auto padding off will only work if the input data&#39;s length is a\nmultiple of the ciphers block size.\nThe decipher.setAutoPadding() method must be called before\ndecipher.update().\ndecipher.update(data[, input_encoding][, output_encoding])\nUpdates the decipher with data.

If the input_encoding\nargument is not given, data must be a Buffer. If data is a\nBuffer then input_encoding is ignored.\nThe output_encoding specifies the output format of the enciphered\ndata, and can be &#39;latin1&#39;, &#39;ascii&#39; or &#39;utf8&#39;. If the output_encoding\nis specified, a string using the specified encoding is returned. If no\noutput_encoding is provided, a Buffer is returned.\nThe decipher.update() method can be called multiple times with new data until\ndecipher.final() is called.

The supplied\nkey is interpreted using the specified input_encoding, and secret is\nencoded using specified output_encoding. Encodings can be\n&#39;latin1&#39;, &#39;hex&#39;, or &#39;base64&#39;.

If encoding is provided public_key is expected to\nbe a string; otherwise a Buffer is expected.\nNote that there is not normally a reason to call this method because ECDH\nonly requires a private key and the other party&#39;s public key to compute the\nshared secret. Typically either ecdh.generateKeys() or\necdh.setPrivateKey() will be called. The ecdh.setPrivateKey() method\nattempts to generate the public point/key associated with the private key being\nset.\nExample (obtaining a shared secret):\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst alice = crypto.createECDH(&#39;secp256k1&#39;);\nconst bob = crypto.createECDH(&#39;secp256k1&#39;);\n\n// Note: This is a shortcut way to specify one of Alice&#39;s previous private\n// keys.

It can be used in one\nof two ways:\n\nAs a writable stream, where data to be signed is written and the\nsign.sign() method is used to generate and return the signature, or\nUsing the sign.update() and sign.sign() methods to produce the\nsignature.\n\nThe crypto.createSign() method is used to create Sign instances.

If private_key is a\nstring, it is treated as a raw key with no passphrase. If private_key is an\nobject, it is interpreted as a hash containing two properties:\n\nkey : {String} - PEM encoded private key\npassphrase : {String} - passphrase for the private key\n\nThe output_format can specify one of &#39;latin1&#39;, &#39;hex&#39; or &#39;base64&#39;. If\noutput_format is provided a string is returned; otherwise a Buffer is\nreturned.\nThe Sign object can not be again used after sign.sign() method has been\ncalled. Multiple calls to sign.sign() will result in an error being thrown.\nsign.update(data[, input_encoding])\nUpdates the Sign content with the given data, the encoding of which\nis given in input_encoding and can be &#39;utf8&#39;, &#39;ascii&#39; or\n&#39;latin1&#39;. If encoding is not provided, and the data is a string, an\nencoding of &#39;utf8&#39; is enforced. If data is a Buffer then\ninput_encoding is ignored.\nThis can be called many times with new data as it is streamed.\nClass: Verify\nThe Verify class is a utility for verifying signatures. It can be used in one\nof two ways:\n\nAs a writable stream where written data is used to validate against the\nsupplied signature, or\nUsing the verify.update() and verify.verify() methods to verify\nthe signature.\nThe crypto.createSign() method is used to create Sign instances.\nSign objects are not to be created directly using the new keyword.\n\n\nExample: Using Verify objects as streams:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst verify = crypto.createVerify(&#39;RSA-SHA256&#39;);\n\nverify.write(&#39;some data to sign&#39;);\nverify.end();\n\nconst public_key = getPublicKeySomehow();\nconst signature = getSignatureToVerify();\nconsole.log(verify.verify(public_key, signature));\n  // Prints true or false\n\nExample: Using the verify.update() and verify.verify() methods:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst verify = crypto.createVerify(&#39;RSA-SHA256&#39;);\n\nverify.update(&#39;some data to sign&#39;);\n\nconst public_key = getPublicKeySomehow();\nconst signature = getSignatureToVerify();\nconsole.log(verify.verify(public_key, signature));\n  // Prints true or false\n\nverifier.update(data[, input_encoding])\nUpdates the Verify content with the given data, the encoding of which\nis given in input_encoding and can be &#39;utf8&#39;, &#39;ascii&#39; or\n&#39;latin1&#39;. If encoding is not provided, and the data is a string, an\nencoding of &#39;utf8&#39; is enforced. If data is a Buffer then\ninput_encoding is ignored.\nThis can be called many times with new data as it is streamed.\nverifier.verify(object, signature[, signature_format])\nVerifies the provided data using the given object and signature.\nThe object argument is a string containing a PEM encoded object, which can be\none an RSA public key, a DSA public key, or an X.509 certificate.\nThe signature argument is the previously calculated signature for the data, in\nthe signature_format which can be &#39;latin1&#39;, &#39;hex&#39; or &#39;base64&#39;.\nIf a signature_format is specified, the signature is expected to be a\nstring; otherwise signature is expected to be a Buffer.\nReturns true or false depending on the validity of the signature for\nthe data and public key.\nThe verifier object can not be used again after verify.verify() has been\ncalled. Multiple calls to verify.verify() will result in an error being\nthrown.\ncrypto module methods and properties\ncrypto.constants\nReturns an object containing commonly used constants for crypto and security\nrelated operations. The specific constants currently defined are described in\nCrypto Constants.\ncrypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING\nThe default encoding to use for functions that can take either strings\nor buffers. The default value is &#39;buffer&#39;, which makes methods\ndefault to Buffer objects.\nThe crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING mechanism is provided for backwards compatibility\nwith legacy programs that expect &#39;latin1&#39; to be the default encoding.\nNew applications should expect the default to be &#39;buffer&#39;. This property may\nbecome deprecated in a future Node.js release.\ncrypto.fips\nProperty for checking and controlling whether a FIPS compliant crypto provider is\ncurrently in use. Setting to true requires a FIPS build of Node.js.\ncrypto.createCipher(algorithm, password)\nCreates and returns a Cipher object that uses the given algorithm and\npassword.\nThe algorithm is dependent on OpenSSL, examples are &#39;aes192&#39;, etc. On\nrecent OpenSSL releases, openssl list-cipher-algorithms will display the\navailable cipher algorithms.\nThe password is used to derive the cipher key and initialization vector (IV).\nThe value must be either a &#39;latin1&#39; encoded string or a Buffer.\nThe implementation of crypto.createCipher() derives keys using the OpenSSL\nfunction EVP_BytesToKey with the digest algorithm set to MD5, one\niteration, and no salt. The lack of salt allows dictionary attacks as the same\npassword always creates the same key. The low iteration count and\nnon-cryptographically secure hash algorithm allow passwords to be tested very\nrapidly.\nIn line with OpenSSL&#39;s recommendation to use pbkdf2 instead of\nEVP_BytesToKey it is recommended that developers derive a key and IV on\ntheir own using crypto.pbkdf2() and to use crypto.createCipheriv()\nto create the Cipher object.\ncrypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv)\nCreates and returns a Cipher object, with the given algorithm, key and\ninitialization vector (iv).\nThe algorithm is dependent on OpenSSL, examples are &#39;aes192&#39;, etc. On\nrecent OpenSSL releases, openssl list-cipher-algorithms will display the\navailable cipher algorithms.\nThe key is the raw key used by the algorithm and iv is an\ninitialization vector. Both arguments must be &#39;latin1&#39; encoded strings or\nbuffers.\ncrypto.createCredentials(details)\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`tls.createSecureContext()`][] instead.\nThe crypto.createCredentials() method is a deprecated alias for creating\nand returning a tls.SecureContext object. The crypto.createCredentials()\nmethod should not be used.\nThe optional details argument is a hash object with keys:\n\npfx : {String|Buffer} - PFX or PKCS12 encoded private\nkey, certificate and CA certificates\nkey : {String} - PEM encoded private key\npassphrase : {String} - passphrase for the private key or PFX\ncert : {String} - PEM encoded certificate\nca : {String|Array} - Either a string or array of strings of PEM encoded CA\ncertificates to trust.\ncrl : {String|Array} - Either a string or array of strings of PEM encoded CRLs\n(Certificate Revocation List)\nciphers: {String} using the OpenSSL cipher list format describing the\ncipher algorithms to use or exclude.\n\nIf no &#39;ca&#39; details are given, Node.js will use Mozilla&#39;s default\npublicly trusted list of CAs.\ncrypto.createDecipher(algorithm, password)\nCreates and returns a Decipher object that uses the given algorithm and\npassword (key).\nThe implementation of crypto.createDecipher() derives keys using the OpenSSL\nfunction EVP_BytesToKey with the digest algorithm set to MD5, one\niteration, and no salt. The lack of salt allows dictionary attacks as the same\npassword always creates the same key. The low iteration count and\nnon-cryptographically secure hash algorithm allow passwords to be tested very\nrapidly.\nIn line with OpenSSL&#39;s recommendation to use pbkdf2 instead of\nEVP_BytesToKey it is recommended that developers derive a key and IV on\ntheir own using crypto.pbkdf2() and to use crypto.createDecipheriv()\nto create the Decipher object.\ncrypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv)\nCreates and returns a Decipher object that uses the given algorithm, key\nand initialization vector (iv).\nThe algorithm is dependent on OpenSSL, examples are &#39;aes192&#39;, etc. On\nrecent OpenSSL releases, openssl list-cipher-algorithms will display the\navailable cipher algorithms.\nThe key is the raw key used by the algorithm and iv is an\ninitialization vector. Both arguments must be &#39;latin1&#39; encoded strings or\nbuffers.\ncrypto.createDiffieHellman(prime[, prime_encoding][, generator][, generator_encoding])\nCreates a DiffieHellman key exchange object using the supplied prime and an\noptional specific generator.\nThe generator argument can be a number, string, or Buffer. If\ngenerator is not specified, the value 2 is used.\nThe prime_encoding and generator_encoding arguments can be &#39;latin1&#39;,\n&#39;hex&#39;, or &#39;base64&#39;.\nIf prime_encoding is specified, prime is expected to be a string; otherwise\na Buffer is expected.\nIf generator_encoding is specified, generator is expected to be a string;\notherwise either a number or Buffer is expected.\ncrypto.createDiffieHellman(prime_length[, generator])\nCreates a DiffieHellman key exchange object and generates a prime of\nprime_length bits using an optional specific numeric generator.\nIf generator is not specified, the value 2 is used.\ncrypto.createECDH(curve_name)\nCreates an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange object using a\npredefined curve specified by the curve_name string. Use\ncrypto.getCurves() to obtain a list of available curve names. On recent\nOpenSSL releases, openssl ecparam -list_curves will also display the name\nand description of each available elliptic curve.\ncrypto.createHash(algorithm)\nCreates and returns a Hash object that can be used to generate hash digests\nusing the given algorithm.\nThe algorithm is dependent on the available algorithms supported by the\nversion of OpenSSL on the platform. Examples are &#39;sha256&#39;, &#39;sha512&#39;, etc.\nOn recent releases of OpenSSL, openssl list-message-digest-algorithms will\ndisplay the available digest algorithms.\nExample: generating the sha256 sum of a file\nconst filename = process.argv[2];\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n\nconst hash = crypto.createHash(&#39;sha256&#39;);\n\nconst input = fs.createReadStream(filename);\ninput.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  var data = input.read();\n  if (data)\n    hash.update(data);\n  else {\n    console.log(`${hash.digest(&#39;hex&#39;)} ${filename}`);\n  }\n});\n\ncrypto.createHmac(algorithm, key)\nCreates and returns an Hmac object that uses the given algorithm and key.\nThe algorithm is dependent on the available algorithms supported by the\nversion of OpenSSL on the platform. Examples are &#39;sha256&#39;, &#39;sha512&#39;, etc.\nOn recent releases of OpenSSL, openssl list-message-digest-algorithms will\ndisplay the available digest algorithms.\nThe key is the HMAC key used to generate the cryptographic HMAC hash.\nExample: generating the sha256 HMAC of a file\nconst filename = process.argv[2];\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n\nconst hmac = crypto.createHmac(&#39;sha256&#39;, &#39;a secret&#39;);\n\nconst input = fs.createReadStream(filename);\ninput.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  var data = input.read();\n  if (data)\n    hmac.update(data);\n  else {\n    console.log(`${hmac.digest(&#39;hex&#39;)} ${filename}`);\n  }\n});\n\ncrypto.createSign(algorithm)\nCreates and returns a Sign object that uses the given algorithm. On\nrecent OpenSSL releases, openssl list-public-key-algorithms will\ndisplay the available signing algorithms. One example is &#39;RSA-SHA256&#39;.\ncrypto.createVerify(algorithm)\nCreates and returns a Verify object that uses the given algorithm. On\nrecent OpenSSL releases, openssl list-public-key-algorithms will\ndisplay the available signing algorithms. One example is &#39;RSA-SHA256&#39;.\ncrypto.getCiphers()\nReturns an array with the names of the supported cipher algorithms.\nExample:\nconst ciphers = crypto.getCiphers();\nconsole.log(ciphers); // [&#39;aes-128-cbc&#39;, &#39;aes-128-ccm&#39;, ...]\n\ncrypto.getCurves()\nReturns an array with the names of the supported elliptic curves.\nExample:\nconst curves = crypto.getCurves();\nconsole.log(curves); // [&#39;secp256k1&#39;, &#39;secp384r1&#39;, ...]\n\ncrypto.getDiffieHellman(group_name)\nCreates a predefined DiffieHellman key exchange object. The\nsupported groups are: &#39;modp1&#39;, &#39;modp2&#39;, &#39;modp5&#39; (defined in\nRFC 2412, but see Caveats) and &#39;modp14&#39;, &#39;modp15&#39;,\n&#39;modp16&#39;, &#39;modp17&#39;, &#39;modp18&#39; (defined in RFC 3526). The\nreturned object mimics the interface of objects created by\ncrypto.createDiffieHellman(), but will not allow changing\nthe keys (with diffieHellman.setPublicKey() for example). The\nadvantage of using this method is that the parties do not have to\ngenerate nor exchange a group modulus beforehand, saving both processor\nand communication time.\nExample (obtaining a shared secret):\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst alice = crypto.getDiffieHellman(&#39;modp14&#39;);\nconst bob = crypto.getDiffieHellman(&#39;modp14&#39;);\n\nalice.generateKeys();\nbob.generateKeys();\n\nconst alice_secret = alice.computeSecret(bob.getPublicKey(), null, &#39;hex&#39;);\nconst bob_secret = bob.computeSecret(alice.getPublicKey(), null, &#39;hex&#39;);\n\n/* alice_secret and bob_secret should be the same */\nconsole.log(alice_secret == bob_secret);\n\ncrypto.getHashes()\nReturns an array with the names of the supported hash algorithms.\nExample:\nconst hashes = crypto.getHashes();\nconsole.log(hashes); // [&#39;sha&#39;, &#39;sha1&#39;, &#39;sha1WithRSAEncryption&#39;, ...]\n\ncrypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, digest, callback)\nProvides an asynchronous Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)\nimplementation. A selected HMAC digest algorithm specified by digest is\napplied to derive a key of the requested byte length (keylen) from the\npassword, salt and iterations.\nThe supplied callback function is called with two arguments: err and\nderivedKey. If an error occurs, err will be set; otherwise err will be\nnull. The successfully generated derivedKey will be passed as a Buffer.\nThe iterations argument must be a number set as high as possible. The\nhigher the number of iterations, the more secure the derived key will be,\nbut will take a longer amount of time to complete.\nThe salt should also be as unique as possible. It is recommended that the\nsalts are random and their lengths are greater than 16 bytes. See\nNIST SP 800-132 for details.\nExample:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\ncrypto.pbkdf2(&#39;secret&#39;, &#39;salt&#39;, 100000, 512, &#39;sha512&#39;, (err, key) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(key.toString(&#39;hex&#39;));  // &#39;c5e478d...1469e50&#39;\n});\n\nAn array of supported digest functions can be retrieved using\ncrypto.getHashes().\ncrypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, iterations, keylen, digest)\nProvides a synchronous Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)\nimplementation. A selected HMAC digest algorithm specified by digest is\napplied to derive a key of the requested byte length (keylen) from the\npassword, salt and iterations.\nIf an error occurs an Error will be thrown, otherwise the derived key will be\nreturned as a Buffer.\nThe iterations argument must be a number set as high as possible. The\nhigher the number of iterations, the more secure the derived key will be,\nbut will take a longer amount of time to complete.\nThe salt should also be as unique as possible. It is recommended that the\nsalts are random and their lengths are greater than 16 bytes. See\nNIST SP 800-132 for details.\nExample:\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\nconst key = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(&#39;secret&#39;, &#39;salt&#39;, 100000, 512, &#39;sha512&#39;);\nconsole.log(key.toString(&#39;hex&#39;));  // &#39;c5e478d...1469e50&#39;\n\nAn array of supported digest functions can be retrieved using\ncrypto.getHashes().\ncrypto.privateDecrypt(private_key, buffer)\nDecrypts buffer with private_key.\nprivate_key can be an object or a string. If private_key is a string, it is\ntreated as the key with no passphrase and will use RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING.\nIf private_key is an object, it is interpreted as a hash object with the\nkeys:\n\nkey : {String} - PEM encoded private key\npassphrase : {String} - Optional passphrase for the private key\npadding : An optional padding value, one of the following:\ncrypto.constants.RSA_NO_PADDING\ncrypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PADDING\ncrypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING\n\n\n\nAll paddings are defined in crypto.constants.\ncrypto.privateEncrypt(private_key, buffer)\nEncrypts buffer with private_key.\nprivate_key can be an object or a string. If private_key is a string, it is\ntreated as the key with no passphrase and will use RSA_PKCS1_PADDING.\nIf private_key is an object, it is interpreted as a hash object with the\nkeys:\n\nkey : {String} - PEM encoded private key\npassphrase : {String} - Optional passphrase for the private key\npadding : An optional padding value, one of the following:\ncrypto.constants.RSA_NO_PADDING\ncrypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PADDING\ncrypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING\n\n\n\nAll paddings are defined in crypto.constants.\ncrypto.publicDecrypt(public_key, buffer)\nDecrypts buffer with public_key.\npublic_key can be an object or a string.

The size argument\nis a number indicating the number of bytes to generate.\nIf a callback function is provided, the bytes are generated asynchronously\nand the callback function is invoked with two arguments: err and buf.\nIf an error occurs, err will be an Error object; otherwise it is null. The\nbuf argument is a Buffer containing the generated bytes.\n// Asynchronous\nconst crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\ncrypto.randomBytes(256, (err, buf) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(`${buf.length} bytes of random data: ${buf.toString(&#39;hex&#39;)}`);\n});\n\nIf the callback function is not provided, the random bytes are generated\nsynchronously and returned as a Buffer. An error will be thrown if\nthere is a problem generating the bytes.\n// Synchronous\nconst buf = crypto.randomBytes(256);\nconsole.log(\n  `${buf.length} bytes of random data: ${buf.toString(&#39;hex&#39;)}`);\n\nThe crypto.randomBytes() method will block until there is sufficient entropy.\nThis should normally never take longer than a few milliseconds. The only time\nwhen generating the random bytes may conceivably block for a longer period of\ntime is right after boot, when the whole system is still low on entropy.\ncrypto.setEngine(engine[, flags])\nLoad and set the engine for some or all OpenSSL functions (selected by flags).\nengine could be either an id or a path to the engine&#39;s shared library.\nThe optional flags argument uses ENGINE_METHOD_ALL by default. The flags\nis a bit field taking one of or a mix of the following flags (defined in\ncrypto.constants):\n\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_RSA\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_DSA\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_DH\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_RAND\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_ECDH\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_ECDSA\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_CIPHERS\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_DIGESTS\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_STORE\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_PKEY_METHS\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_PKEY_ASN1_METHS\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_ALL\ncrypto.constants.ENGINE_METHOD_NONE\n\nNotes\nLegacy Streams API (pre Node.js v0.10)\nThe Crypto module was added to Node.js before there was the concept of a\nunified Stream API, and before there were Buffer objects for handling\nbinary data. As such, the many of the crypto defined classes have methods not\ntypically found on other Node.js classes that implement the streams\nAPI (e.g. update(), final(), or digest()). Also, many methods accepted\nand returned &#39;latin1&#39; encoded strings by default rather than Buffers. This\ndefault was changed after Node.js v0.8 to use Buffer objects by default\ninstead.\nRecent ECDH Changes\nUsage of ECDH with non-dynamically generated key pairs has been simplified.\nNow, ecdh.setPrivateKey() can be called with a preselected private key\nand the associated public point (key) will be computed and stored in the object.\nThis allows code to only store and provide the private part of the EC key pair.\necdh.setPrivateKey() now also validates that the private key is valid for\nthe selected curve.\nThe ecdh.setPublicKey() method is now deprecated as its inclusion in the\nAPI is not useful. Either a previously stored private key should be set, which\nautomatically generates the associated public key, or ecdh.generateKeys()\nshould be called. The main drawback of using ecdh.setPublicKey() is that\nit can be used to put the ECDH key pair into an inconsistent state.\nSupport for weak or compromised algorithms\nThe crypto module still supports some algorithms which are already\ncompromised and are not currently recommended for use. The API also allows\nthe use of ciphers and hashes with a small key size that are considered to be\ntoo weak for safe use.\nUsers should take full responsibility for selecting the crypto\nalgorithm and key size according to their security requirements.\nBased on the recommendations of NIST SP 800-131A:\n\nMD5 and SHA-1 are no longer acceptable where collision resistance is\nrequired such as digital signatures.\nThe key used with RSA, DSA and DH algorithms is recommended to have\nat least 2048 bits and that of the curve of ECDSA and ECDH at least\n224 bits, to be safe to use for several years.\nThe DH groups of modp1, modp2 and modp5 have a key size\nsmaller than 2048 bits and are not recommended.\n\nSee the reference for other recommendations and details.\nCrypto Constants\nThe following constants exported by crypto.constants apply to various uses of \nthe crypto, tls, and https modules and are generally specific to OpenSSL.\nOpenSSL Options\n\n  \n    Constant\n    Description\n  \n  \n    SSL_OP_ALL\n    Applies multiple bug workarounds within OpenSSL.

Developers\nlooking to perform name resolution in the same way that other applications on\nthe same operating system behave should use dns.lookup().\nFor example, looking up nodejs.org.\nconst dns = require(&#39;dns&#39;);\n\ndns.lookup(&#39;nodejs.org&#39;, (err, addresses, family) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;addresses:&#39;, addresses);\n});\n\n2) Functions that connect to an actual DNS server to perform name resolution,\nand that always use the network to perform DNS queries. This category\ncontains all functions in the dns module except dns.lookup(). These\nfunctions do not use the same set of configuration files used by\ndns.lookup() (e.g. /etc/hosts). These functions should be used by\ndevelopers who do not want to use the underlying operating system&#39;s facilities\nfor name resolution, and instead want to always perform DNS queries.\nBelow is an example that resolves &#39;nodejs.org&#39; then reverse resolves the IP\naddresses that are returned.\nconst dns = require(&#39;dns&#39;);\n\ndns.resolve4(&#39;nodejs.org&#39;, (err, addresses) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  console.log(`addresses: ${JSON.stringify(addresses)}`);\n\n  addresses.forEach((a) =&gt; {\n    dns.reverse(a, (err, hostnames) =&gt; {\n      if (err) {\n        throw err;\n      }\n      console.log(`reverse for ${a}: ${JSON.stringify(hostnames)}`);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nThere are subtle consequences in choosing one over the other, please consult\nthe Implementation considerations section for more information.\ndns.getServers()\n\nReturns an array of IP address strings that are being used for name\nresolution.\ndns.lookup(hostname[, options], callback)\n\nResolves a hostname (e.g. &#39;nodejs.org&#39;) into the first found A (IPv4) or\nAAAA (IPv6) record. options can be an object or integer. If options is\nnot provided, then IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are both valid. If options is\nan integer, then it must be 4 or 6.\nAlternatively, options can be an object containing these properties:\n\nfamily {Number} - The record family. If present, must be the integer\n4 or 6. If not provided, both IP v4 and v6 addresses are accepted.\nhints: {Number} - If present, it should be one or more of the supported\ngetaddrinfo flags. If hints is not provided, then no flags are passed to\ngetaddrinfo. Multiple flags can be passed through hints by logically\nORing their values.\nSee supported getaddrinfo flags for more information on supported\nflags.\nall: {Boolean} - When true, the callback returns all resolved addresses\nin an array, otherwise returns a single address. Defaults to false.\n\nAll properties are optional. An example usage of options is shown below.\n{\n  family: 4,\n  hints: dns.ADDRCONFIG | dns.V4MAPPED,\n  all: false\n}\n\nThe callback function has arguments (err, address, family). address is a\nstring representation of an IPv4 or IPv6 address. family is either the\ninteger 4 or 6 and denotes the family of address (not necessarily the\nvalue initially passed to lookup).\nWith the all option set to true, the arguments change to\n(err, addresses), with addresses being an array of objects with the\nproperties address and family.\nOn error, err is an Error object, where err.code is the error code.\nKeep in mind that err.code will be set to &#39;ENOENT&#39; not only when\nthe hostname does not exist but also when the lookup fails in other ways\nsuch as no available file descriptors.\ndns.lookup() does not necessarily have anything to do with the DNS protocol.\nThe implementation uses an operating system facility that can associate names\nwith addresses, and vice versa. This implementation can have subtle but\nimportant consequences on the behavior of any Node.js program. Please take some\ntime to consult the Implementation considerations section before using\ndns.lookup().\nSupported getaddrinfo flags\nThe following flags can be passed as hints to dns.lookup().\n\ndns.ADDRCONFIG: Returned address types are determined by the types\nof addresses supported by the current system. For example, IPv4 addresses\nare only returned if the current system has at least one IPv4 address\nconfigured. Loopback addresses are not considered.\ndns.V4MAPPED: If the IPv6 family was specified, but no IPv6 addresses were\nfound, then return IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses. Note that it is not supported\non some operating systems (e.g FreeBSD 10.1).\n\ndns.lookupService(address, port, callback)\n\nResolves the given address and port into a hostname and service using\nthe operating system&#39;s underlying getnameinfo implementation.\nIf address is not a valid IP address, a TypeError will be thrown.\nThe port will be coerced to a number. If it is not a legal port, a TypeError\nwill be thrown.\nThe callback has arguments (err, hostname, service). The hostname and\nservice arguments are strings (e.g. &#39;localhost&#39; and &#39;http&#39; respectively).\nOn error, err is an Error object, where err.code is the error code.\nconst dns = require(&#39;dns&#39;);\ndns.lookupService(&#39;127.0.0.1&#39;, 22, (err, hostname, service) =&gt; {\n  console.log(hostname, service);\n    // Prints: localhost ssh\n});\n\ndns.resolve(hostname[, rrtype], callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve a hostname (e.g. &#39;nodejs.org&#39;) into an\narray of the record types specified by rrtype.\nValid values for rrtype are:\n\n&#39;A&#39; - IPV4 addresses, default\n&#39;AAAA&#39; - IPV6 addresses\n&#39;MX&#39; - mail exchange records\n&#39;TXT&#39; - text records\n&#39;SRV&#39; - SRV records\n&#39;PTR&#39; - PTR records\n&#39;NS&#39; - name server records\n&#39;CNAME&#39; - canonical name records\n&#39;SOA&#39; - start of authority record\n&#39;NAPTR&#39; - name authority pointer record\n\nThe callback function has arguments (err, addresses). When successful,\naddresses will be an array, except when resolving an SOA record which returns\nan object structured in the same manner as one returned by the\ndns.resolveSoa() method. The type of each item in addresses is\ndetermined by the record type, and described in the documentation for the\ncorresponding lookup methods.\nOn error, err is an Error object, where err.code is\none of the error codes listed here.\ndns.resolve4(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve a IPv4 addresses (A records) for the\nhostname. The addresses argument passed to the callback function\nwill contain an array of IPv4 addresses (e.g.\n[&#39;74.125.79.104&#39;, &#39;74.125.79.105&#39;, &#39;74.125.79.106&#39;]).\ndns.resolve6(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve a IPv6 addresses (AAAA records) for the\nhostname. The addresses argument passed to the callback function\nwill contain an array of IPv6 addresses.\ndns.resolveCname(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve CNAME records for the hostname. The\naddresses argument passed to the callback function\nwill contain an array of canonical name records available for the hostname\n(e.g. [&#39;bar.example.com&#39;]).\ndns.resolveMx(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve mail exchange records (MX records) for the\nhostname. The addresses argument passed to the callback function will\ncontain an array of objects containing both a priority and exchange\nproperty (e.g. [{priority: 10, exchange: &#39;mx.example.com&#39;}, ...]).\ndns.resolveNaptr(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve regular expression based records (NAPTR\nrecords) for the hostname. The callback function has arguments\n(err, addresses).  The addresses argument passed to the callback function\nwill contain an array of objects with the following properties:\n\nflags\nservice\nregexp\nreplacement\norder\npreference\n\nFor example:\n{\n  flags: &#39;s&#39;,\n  service: &#39;SIP+D2U&#39;,\n  regexp: &#39;&#39;,\n  replacement: &#39;_sip._udp.example.com&#39;,\n  order: 30,\n  preference: 100\n}\n\ndns.resolveNs(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve name server records (NS records) for the\nhostname. The addresses argument passed to the callback function will\ncontain an array of name server records available for hostname\n(e.g., [&#39;ns1.example.com&#39;, &#39;ns2.example.com&#39;]).\ndns.resolveSoa(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve a start of authority record (SOA record) for\nthe hostname. The addresses argument passed to the callback function will\nbe an object with the following properties:\n\nnsname\nhostmaster\nserial\nrefresh\nretry\nexpire\nminttl\n\n{\n  nsname: &#39;ns.example.com&#39;,\n  hostmaster: &#39;root.example.com&#39;,\n  serial: 2013101809,\n  refresh: 10000,\n  retry: 2400,\n  expire: 604800,\n  minttl: 3600\n}\n\ndns.resolveSrv(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve service records (SRV records) for the\nhostname. The addresses argument passed to the callback function will\nbe an array of objects with the following properties:\n\npriority\nweight\nport\nname\n\n{\n  priority: 10,\n  weight: 5,\n  port: 21223,\n  name: &#39;service.example.com&#39;\n}\n\ndns.resolvePtr(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve pointer records (PTR records) for the\nhostname. The addresses argument passed to the callback function will\nbe an array of strings containing the reply records.\ndns.resolveTxt(hostname, callback)\n\nUses the DNS protocol to resolve text queries (TXT records) for the\nhostname. The addresses argument passed to the callback function is\nis a two-dimentional array of the text records available for hostname (e.g.,\n[ [&#39;v=spf1 ip4:0.0.0.0 &#39;, &#39;~all&#39; ] ]). Each sub-array contains TXT chunks of\none record. Depending on the use case, these could be either joined together or\ntreated separately.\ndns.reverse(ip, callback)\n\nPerforms a reverse DNS query that resolves an IPv4 or IPv6 address to an\narray of hostnames.\nThe callback function has arguments (err, hostnames), where hostnames\nis an array of resolved hostnames for the given ip.\nOn error, err is an Error object, where err.code is\none of the DNS error codes.\ndns.setServers(servers)\n\nSets the IP addresses of the servers to be used when resolving. The servers\nargument is an array of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.\nIf a port specified on the address it will be removed.\nAn error will be thrown if an invalid address is provided.\nThe dns.setServers() method must not be called while a DNS query is in\nprogress.\nError codes\nEach DNS query can return one of the following error codes:\n\ndns.NODATA: DNS server returned answer with no data.\ndns.FORMERR: DNS server claims query was misformatted.\ndns.SERVFAIL: DNS server returned general failure.\ndns.NOTFOUND: Domain name not found.\ndns.NOTIMP: DNS server does not implement requested operation.\ndns.REFUSED: DNS server refused query.\ndns.BADQUERY: Misformatted DNS query.\ndns.BADNAME: Misformatted hostname.\ndns.BADFAMILY: Unsupported address family.\ndns.BADRESP: Misformatted DNS reply.\ndns.CONNREFUSED: Could not contact DNS servers.\ndns.TIMEOUT: Timeout while contacting DNS servers.\ndns.EOF: End of file.\ndns.FILE: Error reading file.\ndns.NOMEM: Out of memory.\ndns.DESTRUCTION: Channel is being destroyed.\ndns.BADSTR: Misformatted string.\ndns.BADFLAGS: Illegal flags specified.\ndns.NONAME: Given hostname is not numeric.\ndns.BADHINTS: Illegal hints flags specified.\ndns.NOTINITIALIZED: c-ares library initialization not yet performed.\ndns.LOADIPHLPAPI: Error loading iphlpapi.dll.\ndns.ADDRGETNETWORKPARAMS: Could not find GetNetworkParams function.\ndns.CANCELLED: DNS query cancelled.\n\nImplementation considerations\nAlthough dns.lookup() and the various dns.resolve*()/dns.reverse()\nfunctions have the same goal of associating a network name with a network\naddress (or vice versa), their behavior is quite different. These differences\ncan have subtle but significant consequences on the behavior of Node.js\nprograms.\ndns.lookup()\nUnder the hood, dns.lookup() uses the same operating system facilities\nas most other programs. For instance, dns.lookup() will almost always\nresolve a given name the same way as the ping command. On most POSIX-like\noperating systems, the behavior of the dns.lookup() function can be\nmodified by changing settings in nsswitch.conf(5) and/or resolv.conf(5),\nbut note that changing these files will change the behavior of all other\nprograms running on the same operating system.\nThough the call to dns.lookup() will be asynchronous from JavaScript&#39;s\nperspective, it is implemented as a synchronous call to getaddrinfo(3) that\nruns on libuv&#39;s threadpool. Because libuv&#39;s threadpool has a fixed size, it\nmeans that if for whatever reason the call to getaddrinfo(3) takes a long\ntime, other operations that could run on libuv&#39;s threadpool (such as filesystem\noperations) will experience degraded performance. In order to mitigate this\nissue, one potential solution is to increase the size of libuv&#39;s threadpool by\nsetting the &#39;UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE&#39; environment variable to a value greater than\n4 (its current default value). For more information on libuv&#39;s threadpool, see\nthe official libuv documentation.\ndns.resolve(), dns.resolve*() and dns.reverse()\nThese functions are implemented quite differently than dns.lookup().

Once a replacement API has been\nfinalized, this module will be fully deprecated. Most end users should\nnot have cause to use this module. Users who absolutely must have\nthe functionality that domains provide may rely on it for the time being\nbut should expect to have to migrate to a different solution\nin the future.\nDomains provide a way to handle multiple different IO operations as a\nsingle group.  If any of the event emitters or callbacks registered to a\ndomain emit an &#39;error&#39; event, or throw an error, then the domain object\nwill be notified, rather than losing the context of the error in the\nprocess.on(&#39;uncaughtException&#39;) handler, or causing the program to\nexit immediately with an error code.\nWarning: Don&#39;t Ignore Errors!\n\nDomain error handlers are not a substitute for closing down your\nprocess when an error occurs.\nBy the very nature of how throw works in JavaScript, there is almost\nnever any way to safely &quot;pick up where you left off&quot;, without leaking\nreferences, or creating some other sort of undefined brittle state.\nThe safest way to respond to a thrown error is to shut down the\nprocess.  Of course, in a normal web server, you might have many\nconnections open, and it is not reasonable to abruptly shut those down\nbecause an error was triggered by someone else.\nThe better approach is to send an error response to the request that\ntriggered the error, while letting the others finish in their normal\ntime, and stop listening for new requests in that worker.\nIn this way, domain usage goes hand-in-hand with the cluster module,\nsince the master process can fork a new worker when a worker\nencounters an error.  For Node.js programs that scale to multiple\nmachines, the terminating proxy or service registry can take note of\nthe failure, and react accordingly.\nFor example, this is not a good idea:\n// XXX WARNING!  BAD IDEA!\n\nvar d = require(&#39;domain&#39;).create();\nd.on(&#39;error&#39;, (er) =&gt; {\n  // The error won&#39;t crash the process, but what it does is worse!\n  // Though we&#39;ve prevented abrupt process restarting, we are leaking\n  // resources like crazy if this ever happens.\n  // This is no better than process.on(&#39;uncaughtException&#39;)!\n  console.log(&#39;error, but oh well&#39;, er.message);\n});\nd.run(() =&gt; {\n  require(&#39;http&#39;).createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n    handleRequest(req, res);\n  }).listen(PORT);\n});\n\nBy using the context of a domain, and the resilience of separating our\nprogram into multiple worker processes, we can react more\nappropriately, and handle errors with much greater safety.\n// Much better!\n\nconst cluster = require(&#39;cluster&#39;);\nconst PORT = +process.env.PORT || 1337;\n\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\n  // In real life, you&#39;d probably use more than just 2 workers,\n  // and perhaps not put the master and worker in the same file.\n  //\n  // You can also of course get a bit fancier about logging, and\n  // implement whatever custom logic you need to prevent DoS\n  // attacks and other bad behavior.\n  //\n  // See the options in the cluster documentation.\n  //\n  // The important thing is that the master does very little,\n  // increasing our resilience to unexpected errors.\n\n  cluster.fork();\n  cluster.fork();\n\n  cluster.on(&#39;disconnect&#39;, (worker) =&gt; {\n    console.error(&#39;disconnect!&#39;);\n    cluster.fork();\n  });\n\n} else {\n  // the worker\n  //\n  // This is where we put our bugs!\n\n  const domain = require(&#39;domain&#39;);\n\n  // See the cluster documentation for more details about using\n  // worker processes to serve requests.

If they throw, then the domain will catch\nthe error.\nIn order to prevent excessive memory usage, Domain objects themselves\nare not implicitly added as children of the active domain.  If they\nwere, then it would be too easy to prevent request and response objects\nfrom being properly garbage collected.\nIf you want to nest Domain objects as children of a parent Domain,\nthen you must explicitly add them.\nImplicit binding routes thrown errors and &#39;error&#39; events to the\nDomain&#39;s &#39;error&#39; event, but does not register the EventEmitter on the\nDomain, so domain.dispose() will not shut down the EventEmitter.\nImplicit binding only takes care of thrown errors and &#39;error&#39; events.\nExplicit Binding\n\nSometimes, the domain in use is not the one that ought to be used for a\nspecific event emitter.  Or, the event emitter could have been created\nin the context of one domain, but ought to instead be bound to some\nother domain.\nFor example, there could be one domain in use for an HTTP server, but\nperhaps we would like to have a separate domain to use for each request.\nThat is possible via explicit binding.\nFor example:\n// create a top-level domain for the server\nconst domain = require(&#39;domain&#39;);\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\nconst serverDomain = domain.create();\n\nserverDomain.run(() =&gt; {\n  // server is created in the scope of serverDomain\n  http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n    // req and res are also created in the scope of serverDomain\n    // however, we&#39;d prefer to have a separate domain for each request.\n    // create it first thing, and add req and res to it.\n    var reqd = domain.create();\n    reqd.add(req);\n    reqd.add(res);\n    reqd.on(&#39;error&#39;, (er) =&gt; {\n      console.error(&#39;Error&#39;, er, req.url);\n      try {\n        res.writeHead(500);\n        res.end(&#39;Error occurred, sorry.&#39;);\n      } catch (er) {\n        console.error(&#39;Error sending 500&#39;, er, req.url);\n      }\n    });\n  }).listen(1337);\n});\n\ndomain.create()\n\nreturn: {Domain}\n\nReturns a new Domain object.\nClass: Domain\nThe Domain class encapsulates the functionality of routing errors and\nuncaught exceptions to the active Domain object.\nDomain is a child class of EventEmitter.  To handle the errors that it\ncatches, listen to its &#39;error&#39; event.\ndomain.run(fn[, arg][, ...])\n\nfn {Function}\n\nRun the supplied function in the context of the domain, implicitly\nbinding all event emitters, timers, and lowlevel requests that are\ncreated in that context. Optionally, arguments can be passed to\nthe function.\nThis is the most basic way to use a domain.\nExample:\nconst domain = require(&#39;domain&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nconst d = domain.create();\nd.on(&#39;error&#39;, (er) =&gt; {\n  console.error(&#39;Caught error!&#39;, er);\n});\nd.run(() =&gt; {\n  process.nextTick(() =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; { // simulating some various async stuff\n      fs.open(&#39;non-existent file&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, (er, fd) =&gt; {\n        if (er) throw er;\n        // proceed...\n      });\n    }, 100);\n  });\n});\n\nIn this example, the d.on(&#39;error&#39;) handler will be triggered, rather\nthan crashing the program.\ndomain.members\n\n{Array}\n\nAn array of timers and event emitters that have been explicitly added\nto the domain.\ndomain.add(emitter)\n\nemitter {EventEmitter|Timer} emitter or timer to be added to the domain\n\nExplicitly adds an emitter to the domain.  If any event handlers called by\nthe emitter throw an error, or if the emitter emits an &#39;error&#39; event, it\nwill be routed to the domain&#39;s &#39;error&#39; event, just like with implicit\nbinding.\nThis also works with timers that are returned from setInterval() and\nsetTimeout().  If their callback function throws, it will be caught by\nthe domain &#39;error&#39; handler.\nIf the Timer or EventEmitter was already bound to a domain, it is removed\nfrom that one, and bound to this one instead.\ndomain.remove(emitter)\n\nemitter {EventEmitter|Timer} emitter or timer to be removed from the domain\n\nThe opposite of domain.add(emitter).  Removes domain handling from the\nspecified emitter.\ndomain.bind(callback)\n\ncallback {Function} The callback function\nreturn: {Function} The bound function\n\nThe returned function will be a wrapper around the supplied callback\nfunction.  When the returned function is called, any errors that are\nthrown will be routed to the domain&#39;s &#39;error&#39; event.\nExample\nconst d = domain.create();\n\nfunction readSomeFile(filename, cb) {\n  fs.readFile(filename, &#39;utf8&#39;, d.bind((er, data) =&gt; {\n    // if this throws, it will also be passed to the domain\n    return cb(er, data ? JSON.parse(data) : null);\n  }));\n}\n\nd.on(&#39;error&#39;, (er) =&gt; {\n  // an error occurred somewhere.\n  // if we throw it now, it will crash the program\n  // with the normal line number and stack message.\n});\n\ndomain.intercept(callback)\n\ncallback {Function} The callback function\nreturn: {Function} The intercepted function\n\nThis method is almost identical to domain.bind(callback).  However, in\naddition to catching thrown errors, it will also intercept Error\nobjects sent as the first argument to the function.\nIn this way, the common if (err) return callback(err); pattern can be replaced\nwith a single error handler in a single place.\nExample\nconst d = domain.create();\n\nfunction readSomeFile(filename, cb) {\n  fs.readFile(filename, &#39;utf8&#39;, d.intercept((data) =&gt; {\n    // note, the first argument is never passed to the\n    // callback since it is assumed to be the &#39;Error&#39; argument\n    // and thus intercepted by the domain.\n\n    // if this throws, it will also be passed to the domain\n    // so the error-handling logic can be moved to the &#39;error&#39;\n    // event on the domain instead of being repeated throughout\n    // the program.\n    return cb(null, JSON.parse(data));\n  }));\n}\n\nd.on(&#39;error&#39;, (er) =&gt; {\n  // an error occurred somewhere.\n  // if we throw it now, it will crash the program\n  // with the normal line number and stack message.\n});\n\ndomain.enter()\nThe enter method is plumbing used by the run, bind, and intercept\nmethods to set the active domain. It sets domain.active and process.domain\nto the domain, and implicitly pushes the domain onto the domain stack managed\nby the domain module (see domain.exit() for details on the domain stack). The\ncall to enter delimits the beginning of a chain of asynchronous calls and I/O\noperations bound to a domain.\nCalling enter changes only the active domain, and does not alter the domain\nitself. enter and exit can be called an arbitrary number of times on a\nsingle domain.\nIf the domain on which enter is called has been disposed, enter will return\nwithout setting the domain.\ndomain.exit()\nThe exit method exits the current domain, popping it off the domain stack.\nAny time execution is going to switch to the context of a different chain of\nasynchronous calls, it&#39;s important to ensure that the current domain is exited.\nThe call to exit delimits either the end of or an interruption to the chain\nof asynchronous calls and I/O operations bound to a domain.\nIf there are multiple, nested domains bound to the current execution context,\nexit will exit any domains nested within this domain.\nCalling exit changes only the active domain, and does not alter the domain\nitself. enter and exit can be called an arbitrary number of times on a\nsingle domain.\nIf the domain on which exit is called has been disposed, exit will return\nwithout exiting the domain.\ndomain.dispose()\nStability: 0 - Deprecated.  Please recover from failed IO actions\nexplicitly via error event handlers set on the domain.\nOnce dispose has been called, the domain will no longer be used by callbacks\nbound into the domain via run, bind, or intercept, and a &#39;dispose&#39; event\nis emitted.\n"},"errors.html":{"url":"errors.html","title":"Errors","body":"title: errors\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nErrors\n\nApplications running in Node.js will generally experience four categories of\nerrors:\n\nStandard JavaScript errors such as:\n{EvalError} : thrown when a call to eval() fails.\n{SyntaxError} : thrown in response to improper JavaScript language\nsyntax.\n{RangeError} : thrown when a value is not within an expected range\n{ReferenceError} : thrown when using undefined variables\n{TypeError} : thrown when passing arguments of the wrong type\n{URIError} : thrown when a global URI handling function is misused.\n\n\nSystem errors triggered by underlying operating system constraints such\nas attempting to open a file that does not exist, attempting to send data\nover a closed socket, etc;\nAnd User-specified errors triggered by application code.\nAssertion Errors are a special class of error that can be triggered whenever\nNode.js detects an exceptional logic violation that should never occur. These\nare raised typically by the assert module.\n\nAll JavaScript and System errors raised by Node.js inherit from, or are\ninstances of, the standard JavaScript {Error} class and are guaranteed\nto provide at least the properties available on that class.\nError Propagation and Interception\n\nNode.js supports several mechanisms for propagating and handling errors that\noccur while an application is running. How these errors are reported and\nhandled depends entirely on the type of Error and the style of the API that is\ncalled.\nAll JavaScript errors are handled as exceptions that immediately generate\nand throw an error using the standard JavaScript throw mechanism. These\nare handled using the try / catch construct provided by the JavaScript\nlanguage.\n// Throws with a ReferenceError because z is undefined\ntry {\n  const m = 1;\n  const n = m + z;\n} catch (err) {\n  // Handle the error here.\n}\n\nAny use of the JavaScript throw mechanism will raise an exception that\nmust be handled using try / catch or the Node.js process will exit\nimmediately.\nWith few exceptions, Synchronous APIs (any blocking method that does not\naccept a callback function, such as fs.readFileSync), will use throw\nto report errors.\nErrors that occur within Asynchronous APIs may be reported in multiple ways:\n\nMost asynchronous methods that accept a callback function will accept an\nError object passed as the first argument to that function. If that first\nargument is not null and is an instance of Error, then an error occurred\nthat should be handled.\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nfs.readFile(&#39;a file that does not exist&#39;, (err, data) =&gt; {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(&#39;There was an error reading the file!&#39;, err);\n    return;\n  }\n  // Otherwise handle the data\n});\n\n\nWhen an asynchronous method is called on an object that is an EventEmitter,\nerrors can be routed to that object&#39;s &#39;error&#39; event.\nconst net = require(&#39;net&#39;);\nconst connection = net.connect(&#39;localhost&#39;);\n\n// Adding an &#39;error&#39; event handler to a stream:\nconnection.on(&#39;error&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  // If the connection is reset by the server, or if it can&#39;t\n  // connect at all, or on any sort of error encountered by\n  // the connection, the error will be sent here.\n  console.error(err);\n});\n\nconnection.pipe(process.stdout);\n\n\nA handful of typically asynchronous methods in the Node.js API may still\nuse the throw mechanism to raise exceptions that must be handled using\ntry / catch. There is no comprehensive list of such methods; please\nrefer to the documentation of each method to determine the appropriate\nerror handling mechanism required.\n\n\nThe use of the &#39;error&#39; event mechanism is most common for stream-based\nand event emitter-based APIs, which themselves represent a series of\nasynchronous operations over time (as opposed to a single operation that may\npass or fail).\nFor all EventEmitter objects, if an &#39;error&#39; event handler is not\nprovided, the error will be thrown, causing the Node.js process to report an\nunhandled exception and  crash unless either: The domain module is used\nappropriately or a handler has been registered for the\nprocess.on(&#39;uncaughtException&#39;) event.\nconst EventEmitter = require(&#39;events&#39;);\nconst ee = new EventEmitter();\n\nsetImmediate(() =&gt; {\n  // This will crash the process because no &#39;error&#39; event\n  // handler has been added.\n  ee.emit(&#39;error&#39;, new Error(&#39;This will crash&#39;));\n});\n\nErrors generated in this way cannot be intercepted using try / catch as\nthey are thrown after the calling code has already exited.\nDevelopers must refer to the documentation for each method to determine\nexactly how errors raised by those methods are propagated.\nNode.js style callbacks\n\nMost asynchronous methods exposed by the Node.js core API follow an idiomatic\npattern  referred to as a &quot;Node.js style callback&quot;. With this pattern, a\ncallback function is passed to the method as an argument. When the operation\neither completes or an error is raised, the callback function is called with\nthe Error object (if any) passed as the first argument. If no error was raised,\nthe first argument will be passed as null.\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n\nfunction nodeStyleCallback(err, data) {\n if (err) {\n   console.error(&#39;There was an error&#39;, err);\n   return;\n }\n console.log(data);\n}\n\nfs.readFile(&#39;/some/file/that/does-not-exist&#39;, nodeStyleCallback);\nfs.readFile(&#39;/some/file/that/does-exist&#39;, nodeStyleCallback)\n\nThe JavaScript try / catch mechanism cannot be used to intercept errors\ngenerated by asynchronous APIs.  A common mistake for beginners is to try to\nuse throw inside a Node.js style callback:\n// THIS WILL NOT WORK:\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n\ntry {\n  fs.readFile(&#39;/some/file/that/does-not-exist&#39;, (err, data) =&gt; {\n    // mistaken assumption: throwing here...\n    if (err) {\n      throw err;\n    }\n  });\n} catch(err) {\n  // This will not catch the throw!\n  console.log(err);\n}\n\nThis will not work because the callback function passed to fs.readFile() is\ncalled asynchronously. By the time the callback has been called, the\nsurrounding code (including the try { } catch(err) { } block will have\nalready exited. Throwing an error inside the callback can crash the Node.js\nprocess in most cases. If domains are enabled, or a handler has been\nregistered with process.on(&#39;uncaughtException&#39;), such errors can be\nintercepted.\nClass: Error\n\nA generic JavaScript Error object that does not denote any specific\ncircumstance of why the error occurred. Error objects capture a &quot;stack trace&quot;\ndetailing the point in the code at which the Error was instantiated, and may\nprovide a text description of the error.\nAll errors generated by Node.js, including all System and JavaScript errors,\nwill either be instances of, or inherit from, the Error class.\nnew Error(message)\nCreates a new Error object and sets the error.message property to the\nprovided text message. If an object is passed as message, the text message\nis generated by calling message.toString(). The error.stack property will\nrepresent the point in the code at which new Error() was called. Stack traces\nare dependent on V8&#39;s stack trace API. Stack traces extend only to either\n(a) the beginning of  synchronous code execution, or (b) the number of frames\ngiven by the property Error.stackTraceLimit, whichever is smaller.\nError.captureStackTrace(targetObject[, constructorOpt])\nCreates a .stack property on targetObject, which when accessed returns\na string representing the location in the code at which\nError.captureStackTrace() was called.\nconst myObject = {};\nError.captureStackTrace(myObject);\nmyObject.stack  // similar to `new Error().stack`\n\nThe first line of the trace, instead of being prefixed with ErrorType:\nmessage, will be the result of calling targetObject.toString().\nThe optional constructorOpt argument accepts a function. If given, all frames\nabove constructorOpt, including constructorOpt, will be omitted from the\ngenerated stack trace.\nThe constructorOpt argument is useful for hiding implementation\ndetails of error generation from an end user. For instance:\nfunction MyError() {\n  Error.captureStackTrace(this, MyError);\n}\n\n// Without passing MyError to captureStackTrace, the MyError\n// frame would show up in the .stack property. By passing\n// the constructor, we omit that frame and all frames above it.\nnew MyError().stack\n\nError.stackTraceLimit\nThe Error.stackTraceLimit property specifies the number of stack frames\ncollected by a stack trace (whether generated by new Error().stack or\nError.captureStackTrace(obj)).\nThe default value is 10 but may be set to any valid JavaScript number. Changes\nwill affect any stack trace captured after the value has been changed.\nIf set to a non-number value, or set to a negative number, stack traces will\nnot capture any frames.\nerror.message\nReturns the string description of error as set by calling new Error(message).\nThe message passed to the constructor will also appear in the first line of\nthe stack trace of the Error, however changing this property after the\nError object is created may not change the first line of the stack trace.\nconst err = new Error(&#39;The message&#39;);\nconsole.log(err.message);\n  // Prints: The message\n\nerror.stack\nReturns a string describing the point in the code at which the Error was\ninstantiated.\nFor example:\nError: Things keep happening!\n   at /home/gbusey/file.js:525:2\n   at Frobnicator.refrobulate (/home/gbusey/business-logic.js:424:21)\n   at Actor.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/home/gbusey/actors.js:400:8)\n   at increaseSynergy (/home/gbusey/actors.js:701:6)\n\nThe first line is formatted as &lt;error class name&gt;: &lt;error message&gt;, and\nis followed by a series of stack frames (each line beginning with &quot;at &quot;).\nEach frame describes a call site within the code that lead to the error being\ngenerated. V8 attempts to display a name for each function (by variable name,\nfunction name, or object method name), but occasionally it will not be able to\nfind a suitable name. If V8 cannot determine a name for the function, only\nlocation information will be displayed for that frame. Otherwise, the\ndetermined function name will be displayed with location information appended\nin parentheses.\nIt is important to note that frames are only generated for JavaScript\nfunctions. If, for example, execution synchronously passes through a C++ addon\nfunction called cheetahify, which itself calls a JavaScript function, the\nframe representing the cheetahify call will not be present in the stack\ntraces:\nconst cheetahify = require(&#39;./native-binding.node&#39;);\n\nfunction makeFaster() {\n  // cheetahify *synchronously* calls speedy.\n  cheetahify(function speedy() {\n    throw new Error(&#39;oh no!&#39;);\n  });\n}\n\nmakeFaster(); // will throw:\n  // /home/gbusey/file.js:6\n  //     throw new Error(&#39;oh no!&#39;);\n  //           ^\n  // Error: oh no!\n  //     at speedy (/home/gbusey/file.js:6:11)\n  //     at makeFaster (/home/gbusey/file.js:5:3)\n  //     at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/home/gbusey/file.js:10:1)\n  //     at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)\n  //     at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)\n  //     at Module.load (module.js:356:32)\n  //     at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)\n  //     at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)\n  //     at startup (node.js:119:16)\n  //     at node.js:906:3\n\nThe location information will be one of:\n\nnative, if the frame represents a call internal to V8 (as in [].forEach).\nplain-filename.js:line:column, if the frame represents a call internal\n to Node.js.\n/absolute/path/to/file.js:line:column, if the frame represents a call in\na user program, or its dependencies.\n\nThe string representing the stack trace is lazily generated when the\nerror.stack property is accessed.\nThe number of frames captured by the stack trace is bounded by the smaller of\nError.stackTraceLimit or the number of available frames on the current event\nloop tick.\nSystem-level errors are generated as augmented Error instances, which are\ndetailed here.\nClass: RangeError\nA subclass of Error that indicates that a provided argument was not within the\nset or range of acceptable values for a function; whether that is a numeric\nrange, or outside the set of options for a given function parameter.\nFor example:\nrequire(&#39;net&#39;).connect(-1);\n  // throws RangeError, port should be &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; &lt; 65536\n\nNode.js will generate and throw RangeError instances immediately as a form\nof argument validation.\nClass: ReferenceError\nA subclass of Error that indicates that an attempt is being made to access a\nvariable that is not defined. Such errors commonly indicate typos in code, or\nan otherwise broken program.\nWhile client code may generate and propagate these errors, in practice, only V8\nwill do so.\ndoesNotExist;\n  // throws ReferenceError, doesNotExist is not a variable in this program.\n\nReferenceError instances will have an error.arguments property whose value\nis an array containing a single element: a string representing the variable\nthat was not defined.\nconst assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);\ntry {\n  doesNotExist;\n} catch(err) {\n  assert(err.arguments[0], &#39;doesNotExist&#39;);\n}\n\nUnless an application is dynamically generating and running code,\nReferenceError instances should always be considered a bug in the code\nor its dependencies.\nClass: SyntaxError\nA subclass of Error that indicates that a program is not valid JavaScript.\nThese errors may only be generated and propagated as a result of code\nevaluation. Code evaluation may happen as a result of eval, Function,\nrequire, or vm. These errors are almost always indicative of a broken\nprogram.\ntry {\n  require(&#39;vm&#39;).runInThisContext(&#39;binary ! isNotOk&#39;);\n} catch(err) {\n  // err will be a SyntaxError\n}\n\nSyntaxError instances are unrecoverable in the context that created them –\nthey may only be caught by other contexts.\nClass: TypeError\nA subclass of Error that indicates that a provided argument is not an\nallowable type. For example, passing a function to a parameter which expects a\nstring would be considered a TypeError.\nrequire(&#39;url&#39;).parse(() =&gt; { });\n  // throws TypeError, since it expected a string\n\nNode.js will generate and throw TypeError instances immediately as a form\nof argument validation.\nExceptions vs. Errors\n\nA JavaScript exception is a value that is thrown as a result of an invalid\noperation or as the target of a throw statement. While it is not required\nthat these values are instances of Error or classes which inherit from\nError, all exceptions thrown by Node.js or the JavaScript runtime will be\ninstances of Error.\nSome exceptions are unrecoverable at the JavaScript layer. Such exceptions\nwill always cause the Node.js process to crash. Examples include assert()\nchecks or abort() calls in the C++ layer.\nSystem Errors\nSystem errors are generated when exceptions occur within the program&#39;s\nruntime environment. Typically, these are operational errors that occur\nwhen an application violates an operating system constraint such as attempting\nto read a file that does not exist or when the user does not have sufficient\npermissions.\nSystem errors are typically generated at the syscall level: an exhaustive list\nof error codes and their meanings is available by running man 2 intro or\nman 3 errno on most Unices; or online.\nIn Node.js, system errors are represented as augmented Error objects with\nadded properties.\nClass: System Error\nerror.code\nerror.errno\nReturns a string representing the error code, which is always E followed by\na sequence of capital letters, and may be referenced in man 2 intro.\nThe properties error.code and error.errno are aliases of one another and\nreturn the same value.\nerror.syscall\nReturns a string describing the syscall that failed.\nCommon System Errors\nThis list is not exhaustive, but enumerates many of the common system\nerrors encountered when writing a Node.js program. An exhaustive list may be\nfound here.\n\nEACCES (Permission denied): An attempt was made to access a file in a way\nforbidden by its file access permissions.\n\nEADDRINUSE (Address already in use):  An attempt to bind a server\n(net, http, or https) to a local address failed due to\nanother server on the local system already occupying that address.\n\nECONNREFUSED (Connection refused): No connection could be made because the\ntarget machine actively refused it. This usually results from trying to\nconnect to a service that is inactive on the foreign host.\n\nECONNRESET (Connection reset by peer): A connection was forcibly closed by\na peer. This normally results from a loss of the connection on the remote\nsocket due to a timeout or reboot. Commonly encountered via the http\nand net modules.\n\nEEXIST (File exists): An existing file was the target of an operation that\nrequired that the target not exist.\n\nEISDIR (Is a directory): An operation expected a file, but the given\npathname was a directory.\n\nEMFILE (Too many open files in system): Maximum number of\nfile descriptors allowable on the system has been reached, and\nrequests for another descriptor cannot be fulfilled until at least one\nhas been closed. This is encountered when opening many files at once in\nparallel, especially on systems (in particular, OS X) where there is a low\nfile descriptor limit for processes. To remedy a low limit, run\nulimit -n 2048 in the same shell that will run the Node.js process.\n\nENOENT (No such file or directory): Commonly raised by fs operations\nto indicate that a component of the specified pathname does not exist -- no\nentity (file or directory) could be found by the given path.\n\nENOTDIR (Not a directory): A component of the given pathname existed, but\nwas not a directory as expected. Commonly raised by fs.readdir.\n\nENOTEMPTY (Directory not empty): A directory with entries was the target\nof an operation that requires an empty directory -- usually fs.unlink.\n\nEPERM (Operation not permitted): An attempt was made to perform an\noperation that requires elevated privileges.\n\nEPIPE (Broken pipe): A write on a pipe, socket, or FIFO for which there is\nno process to read the data. Commonly encountered at the net and\nhttp layers, indicative that the remote side of the stream being\nwritten to has been closed.\n\nETIMEDOUT (Operation timed out): A connect or send request failed because\nthe connected party did not properly respond after a period of time. Usually\nencountered by http or net -- often a sign that a socket.end()\nwas not properly called.\n\n\n"},"events.html":{"url":"events.html","title":"Events","body":"title: events\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nEvents\nStability: 2 - Stable\n\nMuch of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous\nevent-driven architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called &quot;emitters&quot;)\nperiodically emit named events that cause Function objects (&quot;listeners&quot;) to be\ncalled.\nFor instance: a net.Server object emits an event each time a peer\nconnects to it; a fs.ReadStream emits an event when the file is opened;\na stream emits an event whenever data is available to be read.\nAll objects that emit events are instances of the EventEmitter class. These\nobjects expose an eventEmitter.on() function that allows one or more\nfunctions to be attached to named events emitted by the object. Typically,\nevent names are camel-cased strings but any valid JavaScript property key\ncan be used.\nWhen the EventEmitter object emits an event, all of the functions attached\nto that specific event are called synchronously. Any values returned by the\ncalled listeners are ignored and will be discarded.\nThe following example shows a simple EventEmitter instance with a single\nlistener. The eventEmitter.on() method is used to register listeners, while\nthe eventEmitter.emit() method is used to trigger the event.\nconst EventEmitter = require(&#39;events&#39;);\n\nclass MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}\n\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;an event occurred!&#39;);\n});\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;);\n\nPassing arguments and this to listeners\nThe eventEmitter.emit() method allows an arbitrary set of arguments to be\npassed to the listener functions. It is important to keep in mind that when an\nordinary listener function is called by the EventEmitter, the standard this\nkeyword is intentionally set to reference the EventEmitter to which the\nlistener is attached.\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, function(a, b) {\n  console.log(a, b, this);\n    // Prints:\n    //   a b MyEmitter {\n    //     domain: null,\n    //     _events: { event: [Function] },\n    //     _eventsCount: 1,\n    //     _maxListeners: undefined }\n});\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;);\n\nIt is possible to use ES6 Arrow Functions as listeners, however, when doing so,\nthe this keyword will no longer reference the EventEmitter instance:\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, (a, b) =&gt; {\n  console.log(a, b, this);\n    // Prints: a b {}\n});\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;);\n\nAsynchronous vs. Synchronous\nThe EventListener calls all listeners synchronously in the order in which\nthey were registered. This is important to ensure the proper sequencing of\nevents and to avoid race conditions or logic errors. When appropriate,\nlistener functions can switch to an asynchronous mode of operation using\nthe setImmediate() or process.nextTick() methods:\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, (a, b) =&gt; {\n  setImmediate(() =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;this happens asynchronously&#39;);\n  });\n});\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;);\n\nHandling events only once\nWhen a listener is registered using the eventEmitter.on() method, that\nlistener will be invoked every time the named event is emitted.\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nvar m = 0;\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(++m);\n});\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;);\n  // Prints: 1\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;);\n  // Prints: 2\n\nUsing the eventEmitter.once() method, it is possible to register a listener\nthat is called at most once for a particular event. Once the event is emitted,\nthe listener is unregistered and then called.\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nvar m = 0;\nmyEmitter.once(&#39;event&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(++m);\n});\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;);\n  // Prints: 1\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;);\n  // Ignored\n\nError events\nWhen an error occurs within an EventEmitter instance, the typical action is\nfor an &#39;error&#39; event to be emitted. These are treated as special cases\nwithin Node.js.\nIf an EventEmitter does not have at least one listener registered for the\n&#39;error&#39; event, and an &#39;error&#39; event is emitted, the error is thrown, a\nstack trace is printed, and the Node.js process exits.\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;error&#39;, new Error(&#39;whoops!&#39;));\n  // Throws and crashes Node.js\n\nTo guard against crashing the Node.js process, a listener can be registered\non the process object&#39;s uncaughtException event or the domain module\ncan be used. (Note, however, that the domain module has been deprecated)\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\n\nprocess.on(&#39;uncaughtException&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;whoops! there was an error&#39;);\n});\n\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;error&#39;, new Error(&#39;whoops!&#39;));\n  // Prints: whoops! there was an error\n\nAs a best practice, listeners should always be added for the &#39;error&#39; events.\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;error&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;whoops! there was an error&#39;);\n});\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;error&#39;, new Error(&#39;whoops!&#39;));\n  // Prints: whoops! there was an error\n\nClass: EventEmitter\nThe EventEmitter class is defined and exposed by the events module:\nconst EventEmitter = require(&#39;events&#39;);\n\nAll EventEmitters emit the event &#39;newListener&#39; when new listeners are\nadded and &#39;removeListener&#39; when existing listeners are removed.\nEvent: &#39;newListener&#39;\n\neventName {String|Symbol} The name of the event being listened for\nlistener {Function} The event handler function\n\nThe EventEmitter instance will emit its own &#39;newListener&#39; event before\na listener is added to its internal array of listeners.\nListeners registered for the &#39;newListener&#39; event will be passed the event\nname and a reference to the listener being added.\nThe fact that the event is triggered before adding the listener has a subtle\nbut important side effect: any additional listeners registered to the same\nname within the &#39;newListener&#39; callback will be inserted before the\nlistener that is in the process of being added.\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\n// Only do this once so we don&#39;t loop forever\nmyEmitter.once(&#39;newListener&#39;, (event, listener) =&gt; {\n  if (event === &#39;event&#39;) {\n    // Insert a new listener in front\n    myEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, () =&gt; {\n      console.log(&#39;B&#39;);\n    });\n  }\n});\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;A&#39;);\n});\nmyEmitter.emit(&#39;event&#39;);\n  // Prints:\n  //   B\n  //   A\n\nEvent: &#39;removeListener&#39;\n\neventName {String|Symbol} The event name\nlistener {Function} The event handler function\n\nThe &#39;removeListener&#39; event is emitted after the listener is removed.\nEventEmitter.listenerCount(emitter, eventName)\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`emitter.listenerCount()`][] instead.\nA class method that returns the number of listeners for the given eventName\nregistered on the given emitter.\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, () =&gt; {});\nmyEmitter.on(&#39;event&#39;, () =&gt; {});\nconsole.log(EventEmitter.listenerCount(myEmitter, &#39;event&#39;));\n  // Prints: 2\n\nEventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners\nBy default, a maximum of 10 listeners can be registered for any single\nevent. This limit can be changed for individual EventEmitter instances\nusing the emitter.setMaxListeners(n) method.

However, calling emitter.setMaxListeners(n) still has\nprecedence over EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.\nNote that this is not a hard limit. The EventEmitter instance will allow\nmore listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating\nthat a &quot;possible EventEmitter memory leak&quot; has been detected. For any single\nEventEmitter, the emitter.getMaxListeners() and emitter.setMaxListeners()\nmethods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning:\nemitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1);\nemitter.once(&#39;event&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  // do stuff\n  emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0));\n});\n\nemitter.addListener(eventName, listener)\nAlias for emitter.on(eventName, listener).\nemitter.emit(eventName[, arg1][, arg2][, ...])\nSynchronously calls each of the listeners registered for the event named\neventName, in the order they were registered, passing the supplied arguments\nto each.\nReturns true if the event had listeners, false otherwise.\nemitter.eventNames()\nReturns an array listing the events for which the emitter has registered\nlisteners.

To\nuse this module do require(&#39;fs&#39;). All the methods have asynchronous and\nsynchronous forms.\nThe asynchronous form always takes a completion callback as its last argument.\nThe arguments passed to the completion callback depend on the method, but the\nfirst argument is always reserved for an exception. If the operation was\ncompleted successfully, then the first argument will be null or undefined.\nWhen using the synchronous form any exceptions are immediately thrown.\nYou can use try/catch to handle exceptions or allow them to bubble up.\nHere is an example of the asynchronous version:\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n\nfs.unlink(&#39;/tmp/hello&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(&#39;successfully deleted /tmp/hello&#39;);\n});\n\nHere is the synchronous version:\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n\nfs.unlinkSync(&#39;/tmp/hello&#39;);\nconsole.log(&#39;successfully deleted /tmp/hello&#39;);\n\nWith the asynchronous methods there is no guaranteed ordering. So the\nfollowing is prone to error:\nfs.rename(&#39;/tmp/hello&#39;, &#39;/tmp/world&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(&#39;renamed complete&#39;);\n});\nfs.stat(&#39;/tmp/world&#39;, (err, stats) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(`stats: ${JSON.stringify(stats)}`);\n});\n\nIt could be that fs.stat is executed before fs.rename.\nThe correct way to do this is to chain the callbacks.\nfs.rename(&#39;/tmp/hello&#39;, &#39;/tmp/world&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  fs.stat(&#39;/tmp/world&#39;, (err, stats) =&gt; {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(`stats: ${JSON.stringify(stats)}`);\n  });\n});\n\nIn busy processes, the programmer is strongly encouraged to use the\nasynchronous versions of these calls. The synchronous versions will block\nthe entire process until they complete--halting all connections.\nThe relative path to a filename can be used. Remember, however, that this path\nwill be relative to process.cwd().\nMost fs functions let you omit the callback argument. If you do, a default\ncallback is used that rethrows errors. To get a trace to the original call\nsite, set the NODE_DEBUG environment variable:\n$ cat script.js\nfunction bad() {\n  require(&#39;fs&#39;).readFile(&#39;/&#39;);\n}\nbad();\n\n$ env NODE_DEBUG=fs node script.js\nfs.js:88\n        throw backtrace;\n        ^\nError: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read\n    &lt;stack trace.&gt;\n\nBuffer API\n\nfs functions support passing and receiving paths as both strings\nand Buffers. The latter is intended to make it possible to work with\nfilesystems that allow for non-UTF-8 filenames. For most typical\nuses, working with paths as Buffers will be unnecessary, as the string\nAPI converts to and from UTF-8 automatically.\nNote that on certain file systems (such as NTFS and HFS+) filenames\nwill always be encoded as UTF-8. On such file systems, passing\nnon-UTF-8 encoded Buffers to fs functions will not work as expected.\nClass: fs.FSWatcher\n\nObjects returned from fs.watch() are of this type.\nThe listener callback provided to fs.watch() receives the returned FSWatcher&#39;s\nchange events.\nThe object itself emits these events:\nEvent: &#39;change&#39;\n\n\neventType {String} The type of fs change\nfilename {String | Buffer} The filename that changed (if relevant/available)\n\nEmitted when something changes in a watched directory or file.\nSee more details in fs.watch().\nThe filename argument may not be provided depending on operating system\nsupport. If filename is provided, it will be provided as a Buffer if\nfs.watch() is called with it&#39;s encoding option set to &#39;buffer&#39;, otherwise\nfilename will be a string.\n// Example when handled through fs.watch listener\nfs.watch(&#39;./tmp&#39;, {encoding: &#39;buffer&#39;}, (eventType, filename) =&gt; {\n  if (filename)\n    console.log(filename);\n    // Prints: &lt;Buffer ...&gt;\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;error&#39;\n\n\nerror {Error}\n\nEmitted when an error occurs.\nwatcher.close()\n\nStop watching for changes on the given fs.FSWatcher.\nClass: fs.ReadStream\n\nReadStream is a Readable Stream.\nEvent: &#39;open&#39;\n\n\nfd {Integer} Integer file descriptor used by the ReadStream.\n\nEmitted when the ReadStream&#39;s file is opened.\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nEmitted when the ReadStream&#39;s underlying file descriptor has been closed\nusing the fs.close() method.\nreadStream.path\n\nThe path to the file the stream is reading from as specified in the first\nargument to fs.createReadStream(). If path is passed as a string, then\nreadStream.path will be a string. If path is passed as a Buffer, then\nreadStream.path will be a Buffer.\nClass: fs.Stats\n\nObjects returned from fs.stat(), fs.lstat() and fs.fstat() and their\nsynchronous counterparts are of this type.\n\nstats.isFile()\nstats.isDirectory()\nstats.isBlockDevice()\nstats.isCharacterDevice()\nstats.isSymbolicLink() (only valid with fs.lstat())\nstats.isFIFO()\nstats.isSocket()\n\nFor a regular file util.inspect(stats) would return a string very\nsimilar to this:\n{\n  dev: 2114,\n  ino: 48064969,\n  mode: 33188,\n  nlink: 1,\n  uid: 85,\n  gid: 100,\n  rdev: 0,\n  size: 527,\n  blksize: 4096,\n  blocks: 8,\n  atime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,\n  mtime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,\n  ctime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,\n  birthtime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT\n}\n\nPlease note that atime, mtime, birthtime, and ctime are\ninstances of Date object and to compare the values of\nthese objects you should use appropriate methods. For most general\nuses getTime() will return the number of\nmilliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC and this\ninteger should be sufficient for any comparison, however there are\nadditional methods which can be used for displaying fuzzy information.\nMore details can be found in the MDN JavaScript Reference\npage.\nStat Time Values\nThe times in the stat object have the following semantics:\n\natime &quot;Access Time&quot; - Time when file data last accessed.  Changed\nby the mknod(2), utimes(2), and read(2) system calls.\nmtime &quot;Modified Time&quot; - Time when file data last modified.\nChanged by the mknod(2), utimes(2), and write(2) system calls.\nctime &quot;Change Time&quot; - Time when file status was last changed\n(inode data modification).  Changed by the chmod(2), chown(2),\nlink(2), mknod(2), rename(2), unlink(2), utimes(2),\nread(2), and write(2) system calls.\nbirthtime &quot;Birth Time&quot; -  Time of file creation. Set once when the\nfile is created.  On filesystems where birthtime is not available,\nthis field may instead hold either the ctime or\n1970-01-01T00:00Z (ie, unix epoch timestamp 0). Note that this\nvalue may be greater than atime or mtime in this case. On Darwin\nand other FreeBSD variants, also set if the atime is explicitly\nset to an earlier value than the current birthtime using the\nutimes(2) system call.\n\nPrior to Node v0.12, the ctime held the birthtime on Windows\nsystems.  Note that as of v0.12, ctime is not &quot;creation time&quot;, and\non Unix systems, it never was.\nClass: fs.WriteStream\n\nWriteStream is a Writable Stream.\nEvent: &#39;open&#39;\n\n\nfd {Integer} Integer file descriptor used by the WriteStream.\n\nEmitted when the WriteStream&#39;s file is opened.\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nEmitted when the WriteStream&#39;s underlying file descriptor has been closed\nusing the fs.close() method.\nwriteStream.bytesWritten\n\nThe number of bytes written so far. Does not include data that is still queued\nfor writing.\nwriteStream.path\n\nThe path to the file the stream is writing to as specified in the first\nargument to fs.createWriteStream(). If path is passed as a string, then\nwriteStream.path will be a string. If path is passed as a Buffer, then\nwriteStream.path will be a Buffer.\nfs.access(path[, mode], callback)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nmode {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nTests a user&#39;s permissions for the file or directory specified by path.\nThe mode argument is an optional integer that specifies the accessibility\nchecks to be performed. The following constants define the possible values of\nmode. It is possible to create a mask consisting of the bitwise OR of two or\nmore values.\n\nfs.constants.F_OK - path is visible to the calling process. This is useful\nfor determining if a file exists, but says nothing about rwx permissions.\nDefault if no mode is specified.\nfs.constants.R_OK - path can be read by the calling process.\nfs.constants.W_OK - path can be written by the calling process.\nfs.constants.X_OK - path can be executed by the calling process. This has\nno effect on Windows (will behave like fs.constants.F_OK).\n\nThe final argument, callback, is a callback function that is invoked with\na possible error argument. If any of the accessibility checks fail, the error\nargument will be populated. The following example checks if the file\n/etc/passwd can be read and written by the current process.\nfs.access(&#39;/etc/passwd&#39;, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK, (err) =&gt; {\n  console.log(err ? &#39;no access!&#39; : &#39;can read/write&#39;);\n});\n\nfs.accessSync(path[, mode])\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nmode {Integer}\n\nSynchronous version of fs.access(). This throws if any accessibility\nchecks fail, and does nothing otherwise.\nfs.appendFile(file, data[, options], callback)\n\n\nfile {String | Buffer | Number} filename or file descriptor\ndata {String | Buffer}\noptions {Object | String}\nencoding {String | Null} default = &#39;utf8&#39;\nmode {Integer} default = 0o666\nflag {String} default = &#39;a&#39;\n\n\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronously append data to a file, creating the file if it does not yet exist.\ndata can be a string or a buffer.\nExample:\nfs.appendFile(&#39;message.txt&#39;, &#39;data to append&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(&#39;The &quot;data to append&quot; was appended to file!&#39;);\n});\n\nIf options is a string, then it specifies the encoding. Example:\nfs.appendFile(&#39;message.txt&#39;, &#39;data to append&#39;, &#39;utf8&#39;, callback);\n\nAny specified file descriptor has to have been opened for appending.\nNote: Specified file descriptors will not be closed automatically.\nfs.appendFileSync(file, data[, options])\n\n\nfile {String | Buffer | Number} filename or file descriptor\ndata {String | Buffer}\noptions {Object | String}\nencoding {String | Null} default = &#39;utf8&#39;\nmode {Integer} default = 0o666\nflag {String} default = &#39;a&#39;\n\n\n\nThe synchronous version of fs.appendFile(). Returns undefined.\nfs.chmod(path, mode, callback)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nmode {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous chmod(2). No arguments other than a possible exception are given\nto the completion callback.\nfs.chmodSync(path, mode)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nmode {Integer}\n\nSynchronous chmod(2). Returns undefined.\nfs.chown(path, uid, gid, callback)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nuid {Integer}\ngid {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous chown(2). No arguments other than a possible exception are given\nto the completion callback.\nfs.chownSync(path, uid, gid)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nuid {Integer}\ngid {Integer}\n\nSynchronous chown(2). Returns undefined.\nfs.close(fd, callback)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous close(2).  No arguments other than a possible exception are given\nto the completion callback.\nfs.closeSync(fd)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\n\nSynchronous close(2). Returns undefined.\nfs.constants\nReturns an object containing commonly used constants for file system\noperations. The specific constants currently defined are described in\nFS Constants.\nfs.createReadStream(path[, options])\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\noptions {String | Object}\nflags {String}\nencoding {String}\nfd {Integer}\nmode {Integer}\nautoClose {Boolean}\nstart {Integer}\nend {Integer}\n\n\n\nReturns a new ReadStream object. (See Readable Stream).\nBe aware that, unlike the default value set for highWaterMark on a\nreadable stream (16 kb), the stream returned by this method has a\ndefault value of 64 kb for the same parameter.\noptions is an object or string with the following defaults:\n{\n  flags: &#39;r&#39;,\n  encoding: null,\n  fd: null,\n  mode: 0o666,\n  autoClose: true\n}\n\noptions can include start and end values to read a range of bytes from\nthe file instead of the entire file.  Both start and end are inclusive and\nstart at 0. The encoding can be any one of those accepted by Buffer.\nIf fd is specified, ReadStream will ignore the path argument and will use\nthe specified file descriptor. This means that no &#39;open&#39; event will be\nemitted. Note that fd should be blocking; non-blocking fds should be passed\nto net.Socket.\nIf autoClose is false, then the file descriptor won&#39;t be closed, even if\nthere&#39;s an error.  It is your responsibility to close it and make sure\nthere&#39;s no file descriptor leak.  If autoClose is set to true (default\nbehavior), on error or end the file descriptor will be closed\nautomatically.\nmode sets the file mode (permission and sticky bits), but only if the\nfile was created.\nAn example to read the last 10 bytes of a file which is 100 bytes long:\nfs.createReadStream(&#39;sample.txt&#39;, {start: 90, end: 99});\n\nIf options is a string, then it specifies the encoding.\nfs.createWriteStream(path[, options])\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\noptions {String | Object}\nflags {String}\ndefaultEncoding {String}\nfd {Integer}\nmode {Integer}\nautoClose {Boolean}\nstart {Integer}\n\n\n\nReturns a new WriteStream object. (See Writable Stream).\noptions is an object or string with the following defaults:\n{\n  flags: &#39;w&#39;,\n  defaultEncoding: &#39;utf8&#39;,\n  fd: null,\n  mode: 0o666,\n  autoClose: true\n}\n\noptions may also include a start option to allow writing data at\nsome position past the beginning of the file.  Modifying a file rather\nthan replacing it may require a flags mode of r+ rather than the\ndefault mode w. The defaultEncoding can be any one of those accepted by\nBuffer.\nIf autoClose is set to true (default behavior) on error or end\nthe file descriptor will be closed automatically. If autoClose is false,\nthen the file descriptor won&#39;t be closed, even if there&#39;s an error.\nIt is your responsibility to close it and make sure\nthere&#39;s no file descriptor leak.\nLike ReadStream, if fd is specified, WriteStream will ignore the\npath argument and will use the specified file descriptor. This means that no\n&#39;open&#39; event will be emitted. Note that fd should be blocking; non-blocking\nfds should be passed to net.Socket.\nIf options is a string, then it specifies the encoding.\nfs.exists(path, callback)\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`fs.stat()`][] or [`fs.access()`][] instead.\n\npath {String | Buffer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nTest whether or not the given path exists by checking with the file system.\nThen call the callback argument with either true or false.  Example:\nfs.exists(&#39;/etc/passwd&#39;, (exists) =&gt; {\n  console.log(exists ? &#39;it\\&#39;s there&#39; : &#39;no passwd!&#39;);\n});\n\nfs.exists() should not be used to check if a file exists before calling\nfs.open(). Doing so introduces a race condition since other processes may\nchange the file&#39;s state between the two calls. Instead, user code should\ncall fs.open() directly and handle the error raised if the file is\nnon-existent.\nfs.existsSync(path)\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`fs.statSync()`][] or [`fs.accessSync()`][]\ninstead.\n\npath {String | Buffer}\n\nSynchronous version of fs.exists().\nReturns true if the file exists, false otherwise.\nfs.fchmod(fd, mode, callback)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\nmode {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous fchmod(2). No arguments other than a possible exception\nare given to the completion callback.\nfs.fchmodSync(fd, mode)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\nmode {Integer}\n\nSynchronous fchmod(2).

Returns undefined.\nfs.fstat(fd, callback)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous fstat(2). The callback gets two arguments (err, stats) where\nstats is a fs.Stats object. fstat() is identical to stat(),\nexcept that the file to be stat-ed is specified by the file descriptor fd.\nfs.fstatSync(fd)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\n\nSynchronous fstat(2). Returns an instance of fs.Stats.\nfs.fsync(fd, callback)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous fsync(2).

Returns undefined.\nfs.lstat(path, callback)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous lstat(2). The callback gets two arguments (err, stats) where\nstats is a fs.Stats object. lstat() is identical to stat(),\nexcept that if path is a symbolic link, then the link itself is stat-ed,\nnot the file that it refers to.\nfs.lstatSync(path)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\n\nSynchronous lstat(2). Returns an instance of fs.Stats.\nfs.mkdir(path[, mode], callback)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nmode {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous mkdir(2).

For instance, given a directory\n/tmp, if the intention is to create a temporary directory within /tmp,\nthe prefix must end with a trailing platform-specific path separator\n(require(&#39;path&#39;).sep).\n// The parent directory for the new temporary directory\nconst tmpDir = &#39;/tmp&#39;;\n\n// This method is *INCORRECT*:\nfs.mkdtemp(tmpDir, (err, folder) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(folder);\n    // Will print something similar to `/tmpabc123`.\n    // Note that a new temporary directory is created\n    // at the file system root rather than *within*\n    // the /tmp directory.\n});\n\n// This method is *CORRECT*:\nconst path = require(&#39;path&#39;);\nfs.mkdtemp(tmpDir + path.sep, (err, folder) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(folder);\n    // Will print something similar to `/tmp/abc123`.\n    // A new temporary directory is created within\n    // the /tmp directory.\n});\n\nfs.mkdtempSync(prefix)\n\nThe synchronous version of fs.mkdtemp(). Returns the created\nfolder path.\nfs.open(path, flags[, mode], callback)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nflags {String | Number}\nmode {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronous file open. See open(2). flags can be:\n\n&#39;r&#39; - Open file for reading.\nAn exception occurs if the file does not exist.\n\n&#39;r+&#39; - Open file for reading and writing.\nAn exception occurs if the file does not exist.\n\n&#39;rs+&#39; - Open file for reading and writing in synchronous mode. Instructs\nthe operating system to bypass the local file system cache.\nThis is primarily useful for opening files on NFS mounts as it allows you to\nskip the potentially stale local cache. It has a very real impact on I/O\nperformance so don&#39;t use this flag unless you need it.\nNote that this doesn&#39;t turn fs.open() into a synchronous blocking call.\nIf that&#39;s what you want then you should be using fs.openSync()\n\n&#39;w&#39; - Open file for writing.\nThe file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).\n\n&#39;wx&#39; - Like &#39;w&#39; but fails if path exists.\n\n&#39;w+&#39; - Open file for reading and writing.\nThe file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).\n\n&#39;wx+&#39; - Like &#39;w+&#39; but fails if path exists.\n\n&#39;a&#39; - Open file for appending.\nThe file is created if it does not exist.\n\n&#39;ax&#39; - Like &#39;a&#39; but fails if path exists.\n\n&#39;a+&#39; - Open file for reading and appending.\nThe file is created if it does not exist.\n\n&#39;ax+&#39; - Like &#39;a+&#39; but fails if path exists.\n\n\nmode sets the file mode (permission and sticky bits), but only if the file was\ncreated. It defaults to 0666, readable and writable.\nThe callback gets two arguments (err, fd).\nThe exclusive flag &#39;x&#39; (O_EXCL flag in open(2)) ensures that path is newly\ncreated. On POSIX systems, path is considered to exist even if it is a symlink\nto a non-existent file. The exclusive flag may or may not work with network file\nsystems.\nflags can also be a number as documented by open(2); commonly used constants\nare available from fs.constants.  On Windows, flags are translated to\ntheir equivalent ones where applicable, e.g. O_WRONLY to FILE_GENERIC_WRITE,\nor O_EXCL|O_CREAT to CREATE_NEW, as accepted by CreateFileW.\nOn Linux, positional writes don&#39;t work when the file is opened in append mode.\nThe kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to\nthe end of the file.\nNote: The behavior of fs.open() is platform specific for some flags. As such,\nopening a directory on OS X and Linux with the &#39;a+&#39; flag - see example below -\nwill return an error. In contrast, on Windows and FreeBSD, a file descriptor\nwill be returned.\n// OS X and Linux\nfs.open(&#39;&lt;directory&gt;&#39;, &#39;a+&#39;, (err, fd) =&gt; {\n  // =&gt; [Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, open &lt;directory&gt;]\n});\n\n// Windows and FreeBSD\nfs.open(&#39;&lt;directory&gt;&#39;, &#39;a+&#39;, (err, fd) =&gt; {\n  // =&gt; null, &lt;fd&gt;\n});\n\nfs.openSync(path, flags[, mode])\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\nflags {String | Number}\nmode {Integer}\n\nSynchronous version of fs.open().

Example:\nfs.readFile(&#39;/etc/passwd&#39;, (err, data) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(data);\n});\n\nThe callback is passed two arguments (err, data), where data is the\ncontents of the file.\nIf no encoding is specified, then the raw buffer is returned.\nIf options is a string, then it specifies the encoding. Example:\nfs.readFile(&#39;/etc/passwd&#39;, &#39;utf8&#39;, callback);\n\nAny specified file descriptor has to support reading.\nNote: Specified file descriptors will not be closed automatically.\nfs.readFileSync(file[, options])\n\n\nfile {String | Buffer | Integer} filename or file descriptor\noptions {Object | String}\nencoding {String | Null} default = null\nflag {String} default = &#39;r&#39;\n\n\n\nSynchronous version of fs.readFile.

The type argument can be set to &#39;dir&#39;,\n&#39;file&#39;, or &#39;junction&#39; (default is &#39;file&#39;) and is only available on\nWindows (ignored on other platforms). Note that Windows junction points require\nthe destination path to be absolute. When using &#39;junction&#39;, the target\nargument will automatically be normalized to absolute path.\nHere is an example below:\nfs.symlink(&#39;./foo&#39;, &#39;./new-port&#39;);\n\nIt creates a symbolic link named &quot;new-port&quot; that points to &quot;foo&quot;.\nfs.symlinkSync(target, path[, type])\n\n\ntarget {String | Buffer}\npath {String | Buffer}\ntype {String}\n\nSynchronous symlink(2).

If listener is specified, only that\nparticular listener is removed. Otherwise, all listeners are removed and you\nhave effectively stopped watching filename.\nCalling fs.unwatchFile() with a filename that is not being watched is a\nno-op, not an error.\nNote: fs.watch() is more efficient than fs.watchFile() and fs.unwatchFile().\nfs.watch() should be used instead of fs.watchFile() and fs.unwatchFile()\nwhen possible.\nfs.utimes(path, atime, mtime, callback)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\natime {Integer}\nmtime {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nChange file timestamps of the file referenced by the supplied path.\nNote: the arguments atime and mtime of the following related functions does\nfollow the below rules:\n\nIf the value is a numberable string like &#39;123456789&#39;, the value would get\nconverted to corresponding number.\nIf the value is NaN or Infinity, the value would get converted to\nDate.now().\n\nfs.utimesSync(path, atime, mtime)\n\n\npath {String | Buffer}\natime {Integer}\nmtime {Integer}\n\nSynchronous version of fs.utimes().

The applies when a directory is\nspecified, and only on supported platforms (See Caveats). default =\nfalse\nencoding {String} Specifies the character encoding to be used for the\n filename passed to the listener. default = &#39;utf8&#39;\n\n\nlistener {Function}\n\nWatch for changes on filename, where filename is either a file or a\ndirectory.  The returned object is a fs.FSWatcher.\nThe second argument is optional. If options is provided as a string, it\nspecifies the encoding. Otherwise options should be passed as an object.\nThe listener callback gets two arguments (eventType, filename).  eventType is either\n&#39;rename&#39; or &#39;change&#39;, and filename is the name of the file which triggered\nthe event.\nPlease note the listener callback is attached to the &#39;change&#39; event\nfired by fs.FSWatcher, but they are not the same thing.\nCaveats\n\nThe fs.watch API is not 100% consistent across platforms, and is\nunavailable in some situations.\nThe recursive option is only supported on OS X and Windows.\nAvailability\n\nThis feature depends on the underlying operating system providing a way\nto be notified of filesystem changes.\n\nOn Linux systems, this uses inotify\nOn BSD systems, this uses kqueue\nOn OS X, this uses kqueue for files and FSEvents for directories.\nOn SunOS systems (including Solaris and SmartOS), this uses event ports.\nOn Windows systems, this feature depends on ReadDirectoryChangesW.\nOn Aix systems, this feature depends on AHAFS, which must be enabled.\n\nIf the underlying functionality is not available for some reason, then\nfs.watch will not be able to function. For example, watching files or\ndirectories can be unreliable, and in some cases impossible, on network file\nsystems (NFS, SMB, etc), or host file systems when using virtualization software\nsuch as Vagrant, Docker, etc.\nYou can still use fs.watchFile, which uses stat polling, but it is slower and\nless reliable.\nInodes\n\nOn Linux and OS X systems, fs.watch() resolves the path to an inode and\nwatches the inode. If the watched path is deleted and recreated, it is assigned\na new inode. The watch will emit an event for the delete but will continue\nwatching the original inode. Events for the new inode will not be emitted.\nThis is expected behavior.\nFilename Argument\n\nProviding filename argument in the callback is only supported on Linux and\nWindows.  Even on supported platforms, filename is not always guaranteed to\nbe provided. Therefore, don&#39;t assume that filename argument is always\nprovided in the callback, and have some fallback logic if it is null.\nfs.watch(&#39;somedir&#39;, (eventType, filename) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`event type is: ${eventType}`);\n  if (filename) {\n    console.log(`filename provided: ${filename}`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(&#39;filename not provided&#39;);\n  }\n});\n\nfs.watchFile(filename[, options], listener)\n\n\nfilename {String | Buffer}\noptions {Object}\npersistent {Boolean}\ninterval {Integer}\n\n\nlistener {Function}\n\nWatch for changes on filename. The callback listener will be called each\ntime the file is accessed.\nThe options argument may be omitted. If provided, it should be an object. The\noptions object may contain a boolean named persistent that indicates\nwhether the process should continue to run as long as files are being watched.\nThe options object may specify an interval property indicating how often the\ntarget should be polled in milliseconds. The default is\n{ persistent: true, interval: 5007 }.\nThe listener gets two arguments the current stat object and the previous\nstat object:\nfs.watchFile(&#39;message.text&#39;, (curr, prev) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`the current mtime is: ${curr.mtime}`);\n  console.log(`the previous mtime was: ${prev.mtime}`);\n});\n\nThese stat objects are instances of fs.Stat.\nIf you want to be notified when the file was modified, not just accessed,\nyou need to compare curr.mtime and prev.mtime.\nNote: when an fs.watchFile operation results in an ENOENT error, it will\n invoke the listener once, with all the fields zeroed (or, for dates, the Unix\n Epoch). In Windows, blksize and blocks fields will be undefined, instead\n of zero. If the file is created later on, the listener will be called again,\n with the latest stat objects. This is a change in functionality since v0.10.\nNote: fs.watch() is more efficient than fs.watchFile and\nfs.unwatchFile. fs.watch should be used instead of fs.watchFile and\nfs.unwatchFile when possible.\nfs.write(fd, buffer, offset, length[, position], callback)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\nbuffer {String | Buffer}\noffset {Integer}\nlength {Integer}\nposition {Integer}\ncallback {Function}\n\nWrite buffer to the file specified by fd.\noffset and length determine the part of the buffer to be written.\nposition refers to the offset from the beginning of the file where this data\nshould be written. If typeof position !== &#39;number&#39;, the data will be written\nat the current position. See pwrite(2).\nThe callback will be given three arguments (err, written, buffer) where\nwritten specifies how many bytes were written from buffer.\nNote that it is unsafe to use fs.write multiple times on the same file\nwithout waiting for the callback. For this scenario,\nfs.createWriteStream is strongly recommended.\nOn Linux, positional writes don&#39;t work when the file is opened in append mode.\nThe kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to\nthe end of the file.\nfs.write(fd, data[, position[, encoding]], callback)\n\n\nfd {Integer}\ndata {String | Buffer}\nposition {Integer}\nencoding {String}\ncallback {Function}\n\nWrite data to the file specified by fd.  If data is not a Buffer instance\nthen the value will be coerced to a string.\nposition refers to the offset from the beginning of the file where this data\nshould be written. If typeof position !== &#39;number&#39; the data will be written at\nthe current position. See pwrite(2).\nencoding is the expected string encoding.\nThe callback will receive the arguments (err, written, string) where written\nspecifies how many bytes the passed string required to be written. Note that\nbytes written is not the same as string characters. See Buffer.byteLength.\nUnlike when writing buffer, the entire string must be written. No substring\nmay be specified. This is because the byte offset of the resulting data may not\nbe the same as the string offset.\nNote that it is unsafe to use fs.write multiple times on the same file\nwithout waiting for the callback. For this scenario,\nfs.createWriteStream is strongly recommended.\nOn Linux, positional writes don&#39;t work when the file is opened in append mode.\nThe kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to\nthe end of the file.\nfs.writeFile(file, data[, options], callback)\n\n\nfile {String | Buffer | Integer} filename or file descriptor\ndata {String | Buffer}\noptions {Object | String}\nencoding {String | Null} default = &#39;utf8&#39;\nmode {Integer} default = 0o666\nflag {String} default = &#39;w&#39;\n\n\ncallback {Function}\n\nAsynchronously writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists.\ndata can be a string or a buffer.\nThe encoding option is ignored if data is a buffer. It defaults\nto &#39;utf8&#39;.\nExample:\nfs.writeFile(&#39;message.txt&#39;, &#39;Hello Node.js&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(&#39;It\\&#39;s saved!&#39;);\n});\n\nIf options is a string, then it specifies the encoding. Example:\nfs.writeFile(&#39;message.txt&#39;, &#39;Hello Node.js&#39;, &#39;utf8&#39;, callback);\n\nAny specified file descriptor has to support writing.\nNote that it is unsafe to use fs.writeFile multiple times on the same file\nwithout waiting for the callback. For this scenario,\nfs.createWriteStream is strongly recommended.\nNote: Specified file descriptors will not be closed automatically.\nfs.writeFileSync(file, data[, options])\n\n\nfile {String | Buffer | Integer} filename or file descriptor\ndata {String | Buffer}\noptions {Object | String}\nencoding {String | Null} default = &#39;utf8&#39;\nmode {Integer} default = 0o666\nflag {String} default = &#39;w&#39;\n\n\n\nThe synchronous version of fs.writeFile().

The interface is\ncareful to never buffer entire requests or responses--the\nuser is able to stream data.\nHTTP message headers are represented by an object like this:\n{ &#39;content-length&#39;: &#39;123&#39;,\n  &#39;content-type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;,\n  &#39;connection&#39;: &#39;keep-alive&#39;,\n  &#39;host&#39;: &#39;mysite.com&#39;,\n  &#39;accept&#39;: &#39;*/*&#39; }\n\nKeys are lowercased. Values are not modified.\nIn order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, Node.js&#39;s\nHTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message\nparsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not\nparse the actual headers or the body.\nSee message.headers for details on how duplicate headers are handled.\nThe raw headers as they were received are retained in the rawHeaders\nproperty, which is an array of [key, value, key2, value2, ...].  For\nexample, the previous message header object might have a rawHeaders\nlist like the following:\n[ &#39;ConTent-Length&#39;, &#39;123456&#39;,\n  &#39;content-LENGTH&#39;, &#39;123&#39;,\n  &#39;content-type&#39;, &#39;text/plain&#39;,\n  &#39;CONNECTION&#39;, &#39;keep-alive&#39;,\n  &#39;Host&#39;, &#39;mysite.com&#39;,\n  &#39;accepT&#39;, &#39;*/*&#39; ]\n\nClass: http.Agent\n\nThe HTTP Agent is used for pooling sockets used in HTTP client\nrequests.\nThe HTTP Agent also defaults client requests to using\nConnection:keep-alive. If no pending HTTP requests are waiting on a\nsocket to become free the socket is closed. This means that Node.js&#39;s\npool has the benefit of keep-alive when under load but still does not\nrequire developers to manually close the HTTP clients using\nKeepAlive.\nIf you opt into using HTTP KeepAlive, you can create an Agent object\nwith that flag set to true.  (See the constructor options.)\nThen, the Agent will keep unused sockets in a pool for later use.  They\nwill be explicitly marked so as to not keep the Node.js process running.\nHowever, it is still a good idea to explicitly destroy() KeepAlive\nagents when they are no longer in use, so that the Sockets will be shut\ndown.\nSockets are removed from the agent&#39;s pool when the socket emits either\na &#39;close&#39; event or a special &#39;agentRemove&#39; event. This means that if\nyou intend to keep one HTTP request open for a long time and don&#39;t\nwant it to stay in the pool you can do something along the lines of:\nhttp.get(options, (res) =&gt; {\n  // Do stuff\n}).on(&#39;socket&#39;, (socket) =&gt; {\n  socket.emit(&#39;agentRemove&#39;);\n});\n\nAlternatively, you could just opt out of pooling entirely using\nagent:false:\nhttp.get({\n  hostname: &#39;localhost&#39;,\n  port: 80,\n  path: &#39;/&#39;,\n  agent: false  // create a new agent just for this one request\n}, (res) =&gt; {\n  // Do stuff with response\n});\n\nnew Agent([options])\n\n\noptions {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.\nCan have the following fields:\nkeepAlive {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by\nother requests in the future. Default = false\nkeepAliveMsecs {Integer} When using HTTP KeepAlive, how often\nto send TCP KeepAlive packets over sockets being kept alive.\nDefault = 1000.  Only relevant if keepAlive is set to true.\nmaxSockets {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per\nhost.  Default = Infinity.\nmaxFreeSockets {Number} Maximum number of sockets to leave open\nin a free state.  Only relevant if keepAlive is set to true.\nDefault = 256.\n\n\n\nThe default http.globalAgent that is used by http.request() has all\nof these values set to their respective defaults.\nTo configure any of them, you must create your own http.Agent object.\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\nvar keepAliveAgent = new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true });\noptions.agent = keepAliveAgent;\nhttp.request(options, onResponseCallback);\n\nagent.createConnection(options[, callback])\n\nProduces a socket/stream to be used for HTTP requests.\nBy default, this function is the same as net.createConnection(). However,\ncustom Agents may override this method in case greater flexibility is desired.\nA socket/stream can be supplied in one of two ways: by returning the\nsocket/stream from this function, or by passing the socket/stream to callback.\ncallback has a signature of (err, stream).\nagent.destroy()\n\nDestroy any sockets that are currently in use by the agent.\nIt is usually not necessary to do this.  However, if you are using an\nagent with KeepAlive enabled, then it is best to explicitly shut down\nthe agent when you know that it will no longer be used.  Otherwise,\nsockets may hang open for quite a long time before the server\nterminates them.\nagent.freeSockets\n\nAn object which contains arrays of sockets currently awaiting use by\nthe Agent when HTTP KeepAlive is used.  Do not modify.\nagent.getName(options)\n\nGet a unique name for a set of request options, to determine whether a\nconnection can be reused.  In the http agent, this returns\nhost:port:localAddress.  In the https agent, the name includes the\nCA, cert, ciphers, and other HTTPS/TLS-specific options that determine\nsocket reusability.\nOptions:\n\nhost: A domain name or IP address of the server to issue the request to.\nport: Port of remote server.\nlocalAddress: Local interface to bind for network connections when issuing\nthe request.\n\nagent.maxFreeSockets\n\nBy default set to 256.  For Agents supporting HTTP KeepAlive, this\nsets the maximum number of sockets that will be left open in the free\nstate.\nagent.maxSockets\n\nBy default set to Infinity. Determines how many concurrent sockets the agent\ncan have open per origin. Origin is either a &#39;host:port&#39; or\n&#39;host:port:localAddress&#39; combination.\nagent.requests\n\nAn object which contains queues of requests that have not yet been assigned to\nsockets. Do not modify.\nagent.sockets\n\nAn object which contains arrays of sockets currently in use by the\nAgent.  Do not modify.\nClass: http.ClientRequest\n\nThis object is created internally and returned from http.request().  It\nrepresents an in-progress request whose header has already been queued.  The\nheader is still mutable using the setHeader(name, value), getHeader(name),\nremoveHeader(name) API.  The actual header will be sent along with the first\ndata chunk or when closing the connection.\nTo get the response, add a listener for &#39;response&#39; to the request object.\n&#39;response&#39; will be emitted from the request object when the response\nheaders have been received.  The &#39;response&#39; event is executed with one\nargument which is an instance of http.IncomingMessage.\nDuring the &#39;response&#39; event, one can add listeners to the\nresponse object; particularly to listen for the &#39;data&#39; event.\nIf no &#39;response&#39; handler is added, then the response will be\nentirely discarded.  However, if you add a &#39;response&#39; event handler,\nthen you must consume the data from the response object, either by\ncalling response.read() whenever there is a &#39;readable&#39; event, or\nby adding a &#39;data&#39; handler, or by calling the .resume() method.\nUntil the data is consumed, the &#39;end&#39; event will not fire.  Also, until\nthe data is read it will consume memory that can eventually lead to a\n&#39;process out of memory&#39; error.\nNote: Node.js does not check whether Content-Length and the length of the body\nwhich has been transmitted are equal or not.\nThe request implements the Writable Stream interface. This is an\nEventEmitter with the following events:\nEvent: &#39;abort&#39;\n\nfunction () { }\nEmitted when the request has been aborted by the client. This event is only\nemitted on the first call to abort().\nEvent: &#39;aborted&#39;\n\nfunction () { }\nEmitted when the request has been aborted by the server and the network\nsocket has closed.\nEvent: &#39;checkExpectation&#39;\n\nfunction (request, response) { }\nEmitted each time a request with an http Expect header is received, where the\nvalue is not 100-continue. If this event isn&#39;t listened for, the server will\nautomatically respond with a 417 Expectation Failed as appropriate.\nNote that when this event is emitted and handled, the request event will\nnot be emitted.\nEvent: &#39;connect&#39;\n\nfunction (response, socket, head) { }\nEmitted each time a server responds to a request with a CONNECT method. If this\nevent isn&#39;t being listened for, clients receiving a CONNECT method will have\ntheir connections closed.\nA client server pair that show you how to listen for the &#39;connect&#39; event.\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\nconst net = require(&#39;net&#39;);\nconst url = require(&#39;url&#39;);\n\n// Create an HTTP tunneling proxy\nvar proxy = http.createServer( (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;});\n  res.end(&#39;okay&#39;);\n});\nproxy.on(&#39;connect&#39;, (req, cltSocket, head) =&gt; {\n  // connect to an origin server\n  var srvUrl = url.parse(`http://${req.url}`);\n  var srvSocket = net.connect(srvUrl.port, srvUrl.hostname, () =&gt; {\n    cltSocket.write(&#39;HTTP/1.1 200 Connection Established\\r\\n&#39; +\n                    &#39;Proxy-agent: Node.js-Proxy\\r\\n&#39; +\n                    &#39;\\r\\n&#39;);\n    srvSocket.write(head);\n    srvSocket.pipe(cltSocket);\n    cltSocket.pipe(srvSocket);\n  });\n});\n\n// now that proxy is running\nproxy.listen(1337, &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;, () =&gt; {\n\n  // make a request to a tunneling proxy\n  var options = {\n    port: 1337,\n    hostname: &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;,\n    method: &#39;CONNECT&#39;,\n    path: &#39;www.google.com:80&#39;\n  };\n\n  var req = http.request(options);\n  req.end();\n\n  req.on(&#39;connect&#39;, (res, socket, head) =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;got connected!&#39;);\n\n    // make a request over an HTTP tunnel\n    socket.write(&#39;GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n&#39; +\n                 &#39;Host: www.google.com:80\\r\\n&#39; +\n                 &#39;Connection: close\\r\\n&#39; +\n                 &#39;\\r\\n&#39;);\n    socket.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n      console.log(chunk.toString());\n    });\n    socket.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n      proxy.close();\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;continue&#39;\n\nfunction () { }\nEmitted when the server sends a &#39;100 Continue&#39; HTTP response, usually because\nthe request contained &#39;Expect: 100-continue&#39;. This is an instruction that\nthe client should send the request body.\nEvent: &#39;response&#39;\n\nfunction (response) { }\nEmitted when a response is received to this request.

If this\nevent isn&#39;t being listened for, clients receiving an upgrade header will have\ntheir connections closed.\nA client server pair that show you how to listen for the &#39;upgrade&#39; event.\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\n\n// Create an HTTP server\nvar srv = http.createServer( (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;});\n  res.end(&#39;okay&#39;);\n});\nsrv.on(&#39;upgrade&#39;, (req, socket, head) =&gt; {\n  socket.write(&#39;HTTP/1.1 101 Web Socket Protocol Handshake\\r\\n&#39; +\n               &#39;Upgrade: WebSocket\\r\\n&#39; +\n               &#39;Connection: Upgrade\\r\\n&#39; +\n               &#39;\\r\\n&#39;);\n\n  socket.pipe(socket); // echo back\n});\n\n// now that server is running\nsrv.listen(1337, &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;, () =&gt; {\n\n  // make a request\n  var options = {\n    port: 1337,\n    hostname: &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;,\n    headers: {\n      &#39;Connection&#39;: &#39;Upgrade&#39;,\n      &#39;Upgrade&#39;: &#39;websocket&#39;\n    }\n  };\n\n  var req = http.request(options);\n  req.end();\n\n  req.on(&#39;upgrade&#39;, (res, socket, upgradeHead) =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;got upgraded!&#39;);\n    socket.end();\n    process.exit(0);\n  });\n});\n\nrequest.abort()\n\nMarks the request as aborting. Calling this will cause remaining data\nin the response to be dropped and the socket to be destroyed.\nrequest.end([data][, encoding][, callback])\n\nFinishes sending the request. If any parts of the body are\nunsent, it will flush them to the stream. If the request is\nchunked, this will send the terminating &#39;0\\r\\n\\r\\n&#39;.\nIf data is specified, it is equivalent to calling\nresponse.write(data, encoding) followed by request.end(callback).\nIf callback is specified, it will be called when the request stream\nis finished.\nrequest.flushHeaders()\n\nFlush the request headers.\nFor efficiency reasons, Node.js normally buffers the request headers until you\ncall request.end() or write the first chunk of request data.  It then tries\nhard to pack the request headers and data into a single TCP packet.\nThat&#39;s usually what you want (it saves a TCP round-trip) but not when the first\ndata isn&#39;t sent until possibly much later.  request.flushHeaders() lets you bypass\nthe optimization and kickstart the request.\nrequest.setNoDelay([noDelay])\n\nOnce a socket is assigned to this request and is connected\nsocket.setNoDelay() will be called.\nrequest.setSocketKeepAlive([enable][, initialDelay])\n\nOnce a socket is assigned to this request and is connected\nsocket.setKeepAlive() will be called.\nrequest.setTimeout(timeout[, callback])\n\nOnce a socket is assigned to this request and is connected\nsocket.setTimeout() will be called.\n\ntimeout {Number} Milliseconds before a request is considered to be timed out.\ncallback {Function} Optional function to be called when a timeout occurs. Same as binding to the timeout event.\n\nrequest.write(chunk[, encoding][, callback])\n\nSends a chunk of the body.  By calling this method\nmany times, the user can stream a request body to a\nserver--in that case it is suggested to use the\n[&#39;Transfer-Encoding&#39;, &#39;chunked&#39;] header line when\ncreating the request.\nThe chunk argument should be a Buffer or a string.\nThe encoding argument is optional and only applies when chunk is a string.\nDefaults to &#39;utf8&#39;.\nThe callback argument is optional and will be called when this chunk of data\nis flushed.\nReturns request.\nClass: http.Server\n\nThis class inherits from net.Server and has the following additional events:\nEvent: &#39;checkContinue&#39;\n\nfunction (request, response) { }\nEmitted each time a request with an http Expect: 100-continue is received.\nIf this event isn&#39;t listened for, the server will automatically respond\nwith a 100 Continue as appropriate.\nHandling this event involves calling response.writeContinue() if the client\nshould continue to send the request body, or generating an appropriate HTTP\nresponse (e.g., 400 Bad Request) if the client should not continue to send the\nrequest body.\nNote that when this event is emitted and handled, the &#39;request&#39; event will\nnot be emitted.\nEvent: &#39;clientError&#39;\n\nfunction (exception, socket) { }\nIf a client connection emits an &#39;error&#39; event, it will be forwarded here.\nListener of this event is responsible for closing/destroying the underlying\nsocket. For example, one may wish to more gracefully close the socket with an\nHTTP &#39;400 Bad Request&#39; response instead of abruptly severing the connection.\nDefault behavior is to destroy the socket immediately on malformed request.\nsocket is the net.Socket object that the error originated from.\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.end();\n});\nserver.on(&#39;clientError&#39;, (err, socket) =&gt; {\n  socket.end(&#39;HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\\r\\n\\r\\n&#39;);\n});\nserver.listen(8000);\n\nWhen the &#39;clientError&#39; event occurs, there is no request or response\nobject, so any HTTP response sent, including response headers and payload,\nmust be written directly to the socket object. Care must be taken to\nensure the response is a properly formatted HTTP response message.\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nfunction () { }\nEmitted when the server closes.\nEvent: &#39;connect&#39;\n\nfunction (request, socket, head) { }\nEmitted each time a client requests a http CONNECT method. If this event isn&#39;t\nlistened for, then clients requesting a CONNECT method will have their\nconnections closed.\n\nrequest is the arguments for the http request, as it is in the request\nevent.\nsocket is the network socket between the server and client.\nhead is an instance of Buffer, the first packet of the tunneling stream,\nthis may be empty.\n\nAfter this event is emitted, the request&#39;s socket will not have a &#39;data&#39;\nevent listener, meaning you will need to bind to it in order to handle data\nsent to the server on that socket.\nEvent: &#39;connection&#39;\n\nfunction (socket) { }\nWhen a new TCP stream is established. socket is an object of type\nnet.Socket. Usually users will not want to access this event. In\nparticular, the socket will not emit &#39;readable&#39; events because of how\nthe protocol parser attaches to the socket. The socket can also be\naccessed at request.connection.\nEvent: &#39;request&#39;\n\nfunction (request, response) { }\nEmitted each time there is a request. Note that there may be multiple requests\nper connection (in the case of keep-alive connections).\n request is an instance of http.IncomingMessage and response is\nan instance of http.ServerResponse.\nEvent: &#39;upgrade&#39;\n\nfunction (request, socket, head) { }\nEmitted each time a client requests a http upgrade. If this event isn&#39;t\nlistened for, then clients requesting an upgrade will have their connections\nclosed.\n\nrequest is the arguments for the http request, as it is in the request\nevent.\nsocket is the network socket between the server and client.\nhead is an instance of Buffer, the first packet of the upgraded stream,\nthis may be empty.\n\nAfter this event is emitted, the request&#39;s socket will not have a &#39;data&#39;\nevent listener, meaning you will need to bind to it in order to handle data\nsent to the server on that socket.\nserver.close([callback])\n\nStops the server from accepting new connections.  See net.Server.close().\nserver.listen(handle[, callback])\n\n\nhandle {Object}\ncallback {Function}\n\nThe handle object can be set to either a server or socket (anything\nwith an underlying _handle member), or a {fd: &lt;n&gt;} object.\nThis will cause the server to accept connections on the specified\nhandle, but it is presumed that the file descriptor or handle has\nalready been bound to a port or domain socket.\nListening on a file descriptor is not supported on Windows.\nThis function is asynchronous. callback will be added as a listener for the\n&#39;listening&#39; event. See also net.Server.listen().\nReturns server.\nserver.listen(path[, callback])\n\nStart a UNIX socket server listening for connections on the given path.\nThis function is asynchronous. callback will be added as a listener for the\n&#39;listening&#39; event.  See also net.Server.listen(path).\nserver.listen(port[, hostname][, backlog][, callback])\n\nBegin accepting connections on the specified port and hostname. If the\nhostname is omitted, the server will accept connections on any IPv6 address\n(::) when IPv6 is available, or any IPv4 address (0.0.0.0) otherwise. Use a\nport value of 0 to have the operating system assign an available port.\nTo listen to a unix socket, supply a filename instead of port and hostname.\nBacklog is the maximum length of the queue of pending connections.\nThe actual length will be determined by your OS through sysctl settings such as\ntcp_max_syn_backlog and somaxconn on linux. The default value of this\nparameter is 511 (not 512).\nThis function is asynchronous. callback will be added as a listener for the\n&#39;listening&#39; event.  See also net.Server.listen(port).\nserver.listening\n\nA Boolean indicating whether or not the server is listening for\nconnections.\nserver.maxHeadersCount\n\nLimits maximum incoming headers count, equal to 1000 by default. If set to 0 -\nno limit will be applied.\nserver.setTimeout(msecs, callback)\n\n\nmsecs {Number}\ncallback {Function}\n\nSets the timeout value for sockets, and emits a &#39;timeout&#39; event on\nthe Server object, passing the socket as an argument, if a timeout\noccurs.\nIf there is a &#39;timeout&#39; event listener on the Server object, then it\nwill be called with the timed-out socket as an argument.\nBy default, the Server&#39;s timeout value is 2 minutes, and sockets are\ndestroyed automatically if they time out.  However, if you assign a\ncallback to the Server&#39;s &#39;timeout&#39; event, then you are responsible\nfor handling socket timeouts.\nReturns server.\nserver.timeout\n\n\n{Number} Default = 120000 (2 minutes)\n\nThe number of milliseconds of inactivity before a socket is presumed\nto have timed out.\nNote that the socket timeout logic is set up on connection, so\nchanging this value only affects new connections to the server, not\nany existing connections.\nSet to 0 to disable any kind of automatic timeout behavior on incoming\nconnections.\nClass: http.ServerResponse\n\nThis object is created internally by a HTTP server--not by the user. It is\npassed as the second parameter to the &#39;request&#39; event.\nThe response implements, but does not inherit from, the Writable Stream\ninterface. This is an EventEmitter with the following events:\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nfunction () { }\nIndicates that the underlying connection was terminated before\nresponse.end() was called or able to flush.\nEvent: &#39;finish&#39;\n\nfunction () { }\nEmitted when the response has been sent. More specifically, this event is\nemitted when the last segment of the response headers and body have been\nhanded off to the operating system for transmission over the network. It\ndoes not imply that the client has received anything yet.\nAfter this event, no more events will be emitted on the response object.\nresponse.addTrailers(headers)\n\nThis method adds HTTP trailing headers (a header but at the end of the\nmessage) to the response.\nTrailers will only be emitted if chunked encoding is used for the\nresponse; if it is not (e.g., if the request was HTTP/1.0), they will\nbe silently discarded.\nNote that HTTP requires the Trailer header to be sent if you intend to\nemit trailers, with a list of the header fields in its value. E.g.,\nresponse.writeHead(200, { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;,\n                          &#39;Trailer&#39;: &#39;Content-MD5&#39; });\nresponse.write(fileData);\nresponse.addTrailers({&#39;Content-MD5&#39;: &#39;7895bf4b8828b55ceaf47747b4bca667&#39;});\nresponse.end();\n\nAttempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters\nwill result in a TypeError being thrown.\nresponse.end([data][, encoding][, callback])\n\nThis method signals to the server that all of the response headers and body\nhave been sent; that server should consider this message complete.\nThe method, response.end(), MUST be called on each response.\nIf data is specified, it is equivalent to calling\nresponse.write(data, encoding) followed by response.end(callback).\nIf callback is specified, it will be called when the response stream\nis finished.\nresponse.finished\n\nBoolean value that indicates whether the response has completed. Starts\nas false. After response.end() executes, the value will be true.\nresponse.getHeader(name)\n\nReads out a header that&#39;s already been queued but not sent to the client.  Note\nthat the name is case insensitive.  This can only be called before headers get\nimplicitly flushed.\nExample:\nvar contentType = response.getHeader(&#39;content-type&#39;);\n\nresponse.headersSent\n\nBoolean (read-only). True if headers were sent, false otherwise.\nresponse.removeHeader(name)\n\nRemoves a header that&#39;s queued for implicit sending.\nExample:\nresponse.removeHeader(&#39;Content-Encoding&#39;);\n\nresponse.sendDate\n\nWhen true, the Date header will be automatically generated and sent in\nthe response if it is not already present in the headers. Defaults to true.\nThis should only be disabled for testing; HTTP requires the Date header\nin responses.\nresponse.setHeader(name, value)\n\nSets a single header value for implicit headers.  If this header already exists\nin the to-be-sent headers, its value will be replaced.  Use an array of strings\nhere if you need to send multiple headers with the same name.\nExample:\nresponse.setHeader(&#39;Content-Type&#39;, &#39;text/html&#39;);\n\nor\nresponse.setHeader(&#39;Set-Cookie&#39;, [&#39;type=ninja&#39;, &#39;language=javascript&#39;]);\n\nAttempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters\nwill result in a TypeError being thrown.\nWhen headers have been set with response.setHeader(), they will be merged with\nany headers passed to response.writeHead(), with the headers passed to\nresponse.writeHead() given precedence.\n// returns content-type = text/plain\nconst server = http.createServer((req,res) =&gt; {\n  res.setHeader(&#39;Content-Type&#39;, &#39;text/html&#39;);\n  res.setHeader(&#39;X-Foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;);\n  res.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;});\n  res.end(&#39;ok&#39;);\n});\n\nresponse.setTimeout(msecs, callback)\n\n\nmsecs {Number}\ncallback {Function}\n\nSets the Socket&#39;s timeout value to msecs.  If a callback is\nprovided, then it is added as a listener on the &#39;timeout&#39; event on\nthe response object.\nIf no &#39;timeout&#39; listener is added to the request, the response, or\nthe server, then sockets are destroyed when they time out.  If you\nassign a handler on the request, the response, or the server&#39;s\n&#39;timeout&#39; events, then it is your responsibility to handle timed out\nsockets.\nReturns response.\nresponse.statusCode\n\nWhen using implicit headers (not calling response.writeHead() explicitly),\nthis property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when\nthe headers get flushed.\nExample:\nresponse.statusCode = 404;\n\nAfter response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the\nstatus code which was sent out.\nresponse.statusMessage\n\nWhen using implicit headers (not calling response.writeHead() explicitly), this property\ncontrols the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get\nflushed. If this is left as undefined then the standard message for the status\ncode will be used.\nExample:\nresponse.statusMessage = &#39;Not found&#39;;\n\nAfter response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the\nstatus message which was sent out.\nresponse.write(chunk[, encoding][, callback])\n\nIf this method is called and response.writeHead() has not been called,\nit will switch to implicit header mode and flush the implicit headers.\nThis sends a chunk of the response body. This method may\nbe called multiple times to provide successive parts of the body.\nchunk can be a string or a buffer. If chunk is a string,\nthe second parameter specifies how to encode it into a byte stream.\nBy default the encoding is &#39;utf8&#39;. callback will be called when this chunk\nof data is flushed.\nNote: This is the raw HTTP body and has nothing to do with\nhigher-level multi-part body encodings that may be used.\nThe first time response.write() is called, it will send the buffered\nheader information and the first body to the client. The second time\nresponse.write() is called, Node.js assumes you&#39;re going to be streaming\ndata, and sends that separately. That is, the response is buffered up to the\nfirst chunk of body.\nReturns true if the entire data was flushed successfully to the kernel\nbuffer. Returns false if all or part of the data was queued in user memory.\n&#39;drain&#39; will be emitted when the buffer is free again.\nresponse.writeContinue()\n\nSends a HTTP/1.1 100 Continue message to the client, indicating that\nthe request body should be sent. See the &#39;checkContinue&#39; event on Server.\nresponse.writeHead(statusCode[, statusMessage][, headers])\n\nSends a response header to the request. The status code is a 3-digit HTTP\nstatus code, like 404. The last argument, headers, are the response headers.\nOptionally one can give a human-readable statusMessage as the second\nargument.\nExample:\nvar body = &#39;hello world&#39;;\nresponse.writeHead(200, {\n  &#39;Content-Length&#39;: Buffer.byteLength(body),\n  &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39; });\n\nThis method must only be called once on a message and it must\nbe called before response.end() is called.\nIf you call response.write() or response.end() before calling this,\nthe implicit/mutable headers will be calculated and call this function for you.\nWhen headers have been set with response.setHeader(), they will be merged with\nany headers passed to response.writeHead(), with the headers passed to\nresponse.writeHead() given precedence.\n// returns content-type = text/plain\nconst server = http.createServer((req,res) =&gt; {\n  res.setHeader(&#39;Content-Type&#39;, &#39;text/html&#39;);\n  res.setHeader(&#39;X-Foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;);\n  res.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;});\n  res.end(&#39;ok&#39;);\n});\n\nNote that Content-Length is given in bytes not characters. The above example\nworks because the string &#39;hello world&#39; contains only single byte characters.\nIf the body contains higher coded characters then Buffer.byteLength()\nshould be used to determine the number of bytes in a given encoding.\nAnd Node.js does not check whether Content-Length and the length of the body\nwhich has been transmitted are equal or not.\nAttempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters\nwill result in a TypeError being thrown.\nClass: http.IncomingMessage\n\nAn IncomingMessage object is created by http.Server or\nhttp.ClientRequest and passed as the first argument to the &#39;request&#39;\nand &#39;response&#39; event respectively. It may be used to access response status,\nheaders and data.\nIt implements the Readable Stream interface, as well as the\nfollowing additional events, methods, and properties.\nEvent: &#39;aborted&#39;\n\nfunction () { }\nEmitted when the request has been aborted by the client and the network\nsocket has closed.\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nfunction () { }\nIndicates that the underlying connection was closed.\nJust like &#39;end&#39;, this event occurs only once per response.\nmessage.destroy([error])\n\n\nerror {Error}\n\nCalls destroy() on the socket that received the IncomingMessage. If error\nis provided, an &#39;error&#39; event is emitted and error is passed as an argument\nto any listeners on the event.\nmessage.headers\n\nThe request/response headers object.\nKey-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased.\nExample:\n// Prints something like:\n//\n// { &#39;user-agent&#39;: &#39;curl/7.22.0&#39;,\n//   host: &#39;127.0.0.1:8000&#39;,\n//   accept: &#39;*/*&#39; }\nconsole.log(request.headers);\n\nDuplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the\nheader name:\n\nDuplicates of age, authorization, content-length, content-type,\netag, expires, from, host, if-modified-since, if-unmodified-since,\nlast-modified, location, max-forwards, proxy-authorization, referer,\nretry-after, or user-agent are discarded.\nset-cookie is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array.\nFor all other headers, the values are joined together with &#39;, &#39;.\n\nmessage.httpVersion\n\nIn case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of\nclient response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server.\nProbably either &#39;1.1&#39; or &#39;1.0&#39;.\nAlso message.httpVersionMajor is the first integer and\nmessage.httpVersionMinor is the second.\nmessage.method\n\nOnly valid for request obtained from http.Server.\nThe request method as a string. Read only. Example:\n&#39;GET&#39;, &#39;DELETE&#39;.\nmessage.rawHeaders\n\nThe raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received.\nNote that the keys and values are in the same list.  It is not a\nlist of tuples.  So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the\nodd-numbered offsets are the associated values.\nHeader names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged.\n// Prints something like:\n//\n// [ &#39;user-agent&#39;,\n//   &#39;this is invalid because there can be only one&#39;,\n//   &#39;User-Agent&#39;,\n//   &#39;curl/7.22.0&#39;,\n//   &#39;Host&#39;,\n//   &#39;127.0.0.1:8000&#39;,\n//   &#39;ACCEPT&#39;,\n//   &#39;*/*&#39; ]\nconsole.log(request.rawHeaders);\n\nmessage.rawTrailers\n\nThe raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were\nreceived.

E.G. 404.\nmessage.statusMessage\n\nOnly valid for response obtained from http.ClientRequest.\nThe HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. OK or Internal Server Error.\nmessage.socket\n\nThe net.Socket object associated with the connection.\nWith HTTPS support, use request.socket.getPeerCertificate() to obtain the\nclient&#39;s authentication details.\nmessage.trailers\n\nThe request/response trailers object. Only populated at the &#39;end&#39; event.\nmessage.url\n\nOnly valid for request obtained from http.Server.\nRequest URL string. This contains only the URL that is\npresent in the actual HTTP request. If the request is:\nGET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nAccept: text/plain\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n\nThen request.url will be:\n&#39;/status?name=ryan&#39;\n\nIf you would like to parse the URL into its parts, you can use\nrequire(&#39;url&#39;).parse(request.url).  Example:\n$ node\n&gt; require(&#39;url&#39;).parse(&#39;/status?name=ryan&#39;)\n{\n  href: &#39;/status?name=ryan&#39;,\n  search: &#39;?name=ryan&#39;,\n  query: &#39;name=ryan&#39;,\n  pathname: &#39;/status&#39;\n}\n\nIf you would like to extract the parameters from the query string,\nyou can use the require(&#39;querystring&#39;).parse function, or pass\ntrue as the second argument to require(&#39;url&#39;).parse.  Example:\n$ node\n&gt; require(&#39;url&#39;).parse(&#39;/status?name=ryan&#39;, true)\n{\n  href: &#39;/status?name=ryan&#39;,\n  search: &#39;?name=ryan&#39;,\n  query: {name: &#39;ryan&#39;},\n  pathname: &#39;/status&#39;\n}\n\nhttp.METHODS\n\n\n{Array}\n\nA list of the HTTP methods that are supported by the parser.\nhttp.STATUS_CODES\n\n\n{Object}\n\nA collection of all the standard HTTP response status codes, and the\nshort description of each.  For example, http.STATUS_CODES[404] === &#39;Not\nFound&#39;.\nhttp.createClient([port][, host])\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`http.request()`][] instead.\nConstructs a new HTTP client. port and host refer to the server to be\nconnected to.\nhttp.createServer([requestListener])\n\nReturns a new instance of http.Server.\nThe requestListener is a function which is automatically\nadded to the &#39;request&#39; event.\nhttp.get(options[, callback])\n\nSince most requests are GET requests without bodies, Node.js provides this\nconvenience method. The only difference between this method and http.request()\nis that it sets the method to GET and calls req.end() automatically.\nExample:\nhttp.get(&#39;http://www.google.com/index.html&#39;, (res) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Got response: ${res.statusCode}`);\n  // consume response body\n  res.resume();\n}).on(&#39;error&#39;, (e) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Got error: ${e.message}`);\n});\n\nhttp.globalAgent\n\nGlobal instance of Agent which is used as the default for all http client\nrequests.\nhttp.request(options[, callback])\n\nNode.js maintains several connections per server to make HTTP requests.\nThis function allows one to transparently issue requests.\noptions can be an object or a string. If options is a string, it is\nautomatically parsed with url.parse().\nOptions:\n\nprotocol: Protocol to use. Defaults to &#39;http:&#39;.\nhost: A domain name or IP address of the server to issue the request to.\nDefaults to &#39;localhost&#39;.\nhostname: Alias for host. To support url.parse() hostname is\npreferred over host.\nfamily: IP address family to use when resolving host and hostname.\nValid values are 4 or 6. When unspecified, both IP v4 and v6 will be\nused.\nport: Port of remote server. Defaults to 80.\nlocalAddress: Local interface to bind for network connections.\nsocketPath: Unix Domain Socket (use one of host:port or socketPath).\nmethod: A string specifying the HTTP request method. Defaults to &#39;GET&#39;.\npath: Request path. Defaults to &#39;/&#39;. Should include query string if any.\nE.G. &#39;/index.html?page=12&#39;. An exception is thrown when the request path\ncontains illegal characters. Currently, only spaces are rejected but that\nmay change in the future.\nheaders: An object containing request headers.\nauth: Basic authentication i.e. &#39;user:password&#39; to compute an\nAuthorization header.\nagent: Controls Agent behavior. When an Agent is used request will\ndefault to Connection: keep-alive. Possible values:\nundefined (default): use http.globalAgent for this host and port.\nAgent object: explicitly use the passed in Agent.\nfalse: opts out of connection pooling with an Agent, defaults request to\nConnection: close.\n\n\ncreateConnection: A function that produces a socket/stream to use for the\nrequest when the agent option is not used. This can be used to avoid\ncreating a custom Agent class just to override the default createConnection\nfunction. See agent.createConnection() for more details.\n\nThe optional callback parameter will be added as a one time listener for\nthe &#39;response&#39; event.\nhttp.request() returns an instance of the http.ClientRequest\nclass. The ClientRequest instance is a writable stream. If one needs to\nupload a file with a POST request, then write to the ClientRequest object.\nExample:\nvar postData = querystring.stringify({\n  &#39;msg&#39; : &#39;Hello World!&#39;\n});\n\nvar options = {\n  hostname: &#39;www.google.com&#39;,\n  port: 80,\n  path: &#39;/upload&#39;,\n  method: &#39;POST&#39;,\n  headers: {\n    &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;,\n    &#39;Content-Length&#39;: Buffer.byteLength(postData)\n  }\n};\n\nvar req = http.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);\n  console.log(`HEADERS: ${JSON.stringify(res.headers)}`);\n  res.setEncoding(&#39;utf8&#39;);\n  res.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n    console.log(`BODY: ${chunk}`);\n  });\n  res.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;No more data in response.&#39;);\n  });\n});\n\nreq.on(&#39;error&#39;, (e) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`problem with request: ${e.message}`);\n});\n\n// write data to request body\nreq.write(postData);\nreq.end();\n\nNote that in the example req.end() was called. With http.request() one\nmust always call req.end() to signify that you&#39;re done with the request -\neven if there is no data being written to the request body.\nIf any error is encountered during the request (be that with DNS resolution,\nTCP level errors, or actual HTTP parse errors) an &#39;error&#39; event is emitted\non the returned request object. As with all &#39;error&#39; events, if no listeners\nare registered the error will be thrown.\nThere are a few special headers that should be noted.\n\nSending a &#39;Connection: keep-alive&#39; will notify Node.js that the connection to\nthe server should be persisted until the next request.\n\nSending a &#39;Content-length&#39; header will disable the default chunked encoding.\n\nSending an &#39;Expect&#39; header will immediately send the request headers.\nUsually, when sending &#39;Expect: 100-continue&#39;, you should both set a timeout\nand listen for the &#39;continue&#39; event. See RFC2616 Section 8.2.3 for more\ninformation.\n\nSending an Authorization header will override using the auth option\nto compute basic authentication.\n\n\n"},"https.html":{"url":"https.html","title":"HTTPS","body":"title: https\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nHTTPS\nStability: 2 - Stable\nHTTPS is the HTTP protocol over TLS/SSL.

In Node.js, files and modules are\nin one-to-one correspondence.  As an example, foo.js loads the module\ncircle.js in the same directory.\nThe contents of foo.js:\nconst circle = require(&#39;./circle.js&#39;);\nconsole.log(`The area of a circle of radius 4 is ${circle.area(4)}`);\n\nThe contents of circle.js:\nconst PI = Math.PI;\n\nexports.area = (r) =&gt; PI * r * r;\n\nexports.circumference = (r) =&gt; 2 * PI * r;\n\nThe module circle.js has exported the functions area() and\ncircumference().  To add functions and objects to the root of your module,\nyou can add them to the special exports object.\nVariables local to the module will be private, because the module is wrapped\nin a function by Node.js (see module wrapper).\nIn this example, the variable PI is private to circle.js.\nIf you want the root of your module&#39;s export to be a function (such as a\nconstructor) or if you want to export a complete object in one assignment\ninstead of building it one property at a time, assign it to module.exports\ninstead of exports.\nBelow, bar.js makes use of the square module, which exports a constructor:\nconst square = require(&#39;./square.js&#39;);\nvar mySquare = square(2);\nconsole.log(`The area of my square is ${mySquare.area()}`);\n\nThe square module is defined in square.js:\n// assigning to exports will not modify module, must use module.exports\nmodule.exports = (width) =&gt; {\n  return {\n    area: () =&gt; width * width\n  };\n}\n\nThe module system is implemented in the require(&quot;module&quot;) module.\nAccessing the main module\n\nWhen a file is run directly from Node.js, require.main is set to its\nmodule. That means that you can determine whether a file has been run\ndirectly by testing\nrequire.main === module\n\nFor a file foo.js, this will be true if run via node foo.js, but\nfalse if run by require(&#39;./foo&#39;).\nBecause module provides a filename property (normally equivalent to\n__filename), the entry point of the current application can be obtained\nby checking require.main.filename.\nAddenda: Package Manager Tips\n\nThe semantics of Node.js&#39;s require() function were designed to be general\nenough to support a number of reasonable directory structures. Package manager\nprograms such as dpkg, rpm, and npm will hopefully find it possible to\nbuild native packages from Node.js modules without modification.\nBelow we give a suggested directory structure that could work:\nLet&#39;s say that we wanted to have the folder at\n/usr/lib/node/&lt;some-package&gt;/&lt;some-version&gt; hold the contents of a\nspecific version of a package.\nPackages can depend on one another. In order to install package foo, you\nmay have to install a specific version of package bar.  The bar package\nmay itself have dependencies, and in some cases, these dependencies may even\ncollide or form cycles.\nSince Node.js looks up the realpath of any modules it loads (that is,\nresolves symlinks), and then looks for their dependencies in the node_modules\nfolders as described here, this\nsituation is very simple to resolve with the following architecture:\n\n/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/ - Contents of the foo package, version 1.2.3.\n/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/ - Contents of the bar package that foo\ndepends on.\n/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/node_modules/bar - Symbolic link to\n/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/.\n/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/node_modules/* - Symbolic links to the packages\nthat bar depends on.\n\nThus, even if a cycle is encountered, or if there are dependency\nconflicts, every module will be able to get a version of its dependency\nthat it can use.\nWhen the code in the foo package does require(&#39;bar&#39;), it will get the\nversion that is symlinked into /usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/node_modules/bar.\nThen, when the code in the bar package calls require(&#39;quux&#39;), it&#39;ll get\nthe version that is symlinked into\n/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/node_modules/quux.\nFurthermore, to make the module lookup process even more optimal, rather\nthan putting packages directly in /usr/lib/node, we could put them in\n/usr/lib/node_modules/&lt;name&gt;/&lt;version&gt;.  Then Node.js will not bother\nlooking for missing dependencies in /usr/node_modules or /node_modules.\nIn order to make modules available to the Node.js REPL, it might be useful to\nalso add the /usr/lib/node_modules folder to the $NODE_PATH environment\nvariable.  Since the module lookups using node_modules folders are all\nrelative, and based on the real path of the files making the calls to\nrequire(), the packages themselves can be anywhere.\nAll Together...\n\nTo get the exact filename that will be loaded when require() is called, use\nthe require.resolve() function.\nPutting together all of the above, here is the high-level algorithm\nin pseudocode of what require.resolve does:\nrequire(X) from module at path Y\n1. If X is a core module,\n   a. return the core module\n   b. STOP\n2. If X begins with &#39;./&#39; or &#39;/&#39; or &#39;../&#39;\n   a. LOAD_AS_FILE(Y + X)\n   b. LOAD_AS_DIRECTORY(Y + X)\n3. LOAD_NODE_MODULES(X, dirname(Y))\n4. THROW &quot;not found&quot;\n\nLOAD_AS_FILE(X)\n1. If X is a file, load X as JavaScript text.  STOP\n2. If X.js is a file, load X.js as JavaScript text.  STOP\n3. If X.json is a file, parse X.json to a JavaScript Object.  STOP\n4. If X.node is a file, load X.node as binary addon.  STOP\n\nLOAD_AS_DIRECTORY(X)\n1. If X/package.json is a file,\n   a. Parse X/package.json, and look for &quot;main&quot; field.\n   b. let M = X + (json main field)\n   c. LOAD_AS_FILE(M)\n2. If X/index.js is a file, load X/index.js as JavaScript text.  STOP\n3. If X/index.json is a file, parse X/index.json to a JavaScript object. STOP\n4. If X/index.node is a file, load X/index.node as binary addon.  STOP\n\nLOAD_NODE_MODULES(X, START)\n1. let DIRS=NODE_MODULES_PATHS(START)\n2. for each DIR in DIRS:\n   a. LOAD_AS_FILE(DIR/X)\n   b. LOAD_AS_DIRECTORY(DIR/X)\n\nNODE_MODULES_PATHS(START)\n1. let PARTS = path split(START)\n2. let I = count of PARTS - 1\n3. let DIRS = []\n4. while I &gt;= 0,\n   a. if PARTS[I] = &quot;node_modules&quot; CONTINUE\n   c. DIR = path join(PARTS[0 .. I] + &quot;node_modules&quot;)\n   b. DIRS = DIRS + DIR\n   c. let I = I - 1\n5. return DIRS\n\nCaching\n\nModules are cached after the first time they are loaded.  This means\n(among other things) that every call to require(&#39;foo&#39;) will get\nexactly the same object returned, if it would resolve to the same file.\nMultiple calls to require(&#39;foo&#39;) may not cause the module code to be\nexecuted multiple times.  This is an important feature.  With it,\n&quot;partially done&quot; objects can be returned, thus allowing transitive\ndependencies to be loaded even when they would cause cycles.\nIf you want to have a module execute code multiple times, then export a\nfunction, and call that function.\nModule Caching Caveats\n\nModules are cached based on their resolved filename.  Since modules may\nresolve to a different filename based on the location of the calling\nmodule (loading from node_modules folders), it is not a guarantee\nthat require(&#39;foo&#39;) will always return the exact same object, if it\nwould resolve to different files.\nAdditionally, on case-insensitive file systems or operating systems, different\nresolved filenames can point to the same file, but the cache will still treat\nthem as different modules and will reload the file multiple times. For example,\nrequire(&#39;./foo&#39;) and require(&#39;./FOO&#39;) return two different objects,\nirrespective of whether or not ./foo and ./FOO are the same file.\nCore Modules\n\nNode.js has several modules compiled into the binary.  These modules are\ndescribed in greater detail elsewhere in this documentation.\nThe core modules are defined within Node.js&#39;s source and are located in the\nlib/ folder.\nCore modules are always preferentially loaded if their identifier is\npassed to require().  For instance, require(&#39;http&#39;) will always\nreturn the built in HTTP module, even if there is a file by that name.\nCycles\n\nWhen there are circular require() calls, a module might not have finished\nexecuting when it is returned.\nConsider this situation:\na.js:\nconsole.log(&#39;a starting&#39;);\nexports.done = false;\nconst b = require(&#39;./b.js&#39;);\nconsole.log(&#39;in a, b.done = %j&#39;, b.done);\nexports.done = true;\nconsole.log(&#39;a done&#39;);\n\nb.js:\nconsole.log(&#39;b starting&#39;);\nexports.done = false;\nconst a = require(&#39;./a.js&#39;);\nconsole.log(&#39;in b, a.done = %j&#39;, a.done);\nexports.done = true;\nconsole.log(&#39;b done&#39;);\n\nmain.js:\nconsole.log(&#39;main starting&#39;);\nconst a = require(&#39;./a.js&#39;);\nconst b = require(&#39;./b.js&#39;);\nconsole.log(&#39;in main, a.done=%j, b.done=%j&#39;, a.done, b.done);\n\nWhen main.js loads a.js, then a.js in turn loads b.js.  At that\npoint, b.js tries to load a.js.  In order to prevent an infinite\nloop, an unfinished copy of the a.js exports object is returned to the\nb.js module.  b.js then finishes loading, and its exports object is\nprovided to the a.js module.\nBy the time main.js has loaded both modules, they&#39;re both finished.\nThe output of this program would thus be:\n$ node main.js\nmain starting\na starting\nb starting\nin b, a.done = false\nb done\nin a, b.done = true\na done\nin main, a.done=true, b.done=true\n\nIf you have cyclic module dependencies in your program, make sure to\nplan accordingly.\nFile Modules\n\nIf the exact filename is not found, then Node.js will attempt to load the\nrequired filename with the added extensions: .js, .json, and finally\n.node.\n.js files are interpreted as JavaScript text files, and .json files are\nparsed as JSON text files. .node files are interpreted as compiled addon\nmodules loaded with dlopen.\nA required module prefixed with &#39;/&#39; is an absolute path to the file.  For\nexample, require(&#39;/home/marco/foo.js&#39;) will load the file at\n/home/marco/foo.js.\nA required module prefixed with &#39;./&#39; is relative to the file calling\nrequire(). That is, circle.js must be in the same directory as foo.js for\nrequire(&#39;./circle&#39;) to find it.\nWithout a leading &#39;/&#39;, &#39;./&#39;, or &#39;../&#39; to indicate a file, the module must\neither be a core module or is loaded from a node_modules folder.\nIf the given path does not exist, require() will throw an Error with its\ncode property set to &#39;MODULE_NOT_FOUND&#39;.\nFolders as Modules\n\nIt is convenient to organize programs and libraries into self-contained\ndirectories, and then provide a single entry point to that library.\nThere are three ways in which a folder may be passed to require() as\nan argument.\nThe first is to create a package.json file in the root of the folder,\nwhich specifies a main module.  An example package.json file might\nlook like this:\n{ &quot;name&quot; : &quot;some-library&quot;,\n  &quot;main&quot; : &quot;./lib/some-library.js&quot; }\n\nIf this was in a folder at ./some-library, then\nrequire(&#39;./some-library&#39;) would attempt to load\n./some-library/lib/some-library.js.\nThis is the extent of Node.js&#39;s awareness of package.json files.\nNote: If the file specified by the &quot;main&quot; entry of package.json is missing\nand can not be resolved, Node.js will report the entire module as missing with\nthe default error:\nError: Cannot find module &#39;some-library&#39;\n\nIf there is no package.json file present in the directory, then Node.js\nwill attempt to load an index.js or index.node file out of that\ndirectory.  For example, if there was no package.json file in the above\nexample, then require(&#39;./some-library&#39;) would attempt to load:\n\n./some-library/index.js\n./some-library/index.node\n\nLoading from node_modules Folders\n\nIf the module identifier passed to require() is not a native module,\nand does not begin with &#39;/&#39;, &#39;../&#39;, or &#39;./&#39;, then Node.js starts at the\nparent directory of the current module, and adds /node_modules, and\nattempts to load the module from that location. Node will not append\nnode_modules to a path already ending in node_modules.\nIf it is not found there, then it moves to the parent directory, and so\non, until the root of the file system is reached.\nFor example, if the file at &#39;/home/ry/projects/foo.js&#39; called\nrequire(&#39;bar.js&#39;), then Node.js would look in the following locations, in\nthis order:\n\n/home/ry/projects/node_modules/bar.js\n/home/ry/node_modules/bar.js\n/home/node_modules/bar.js\n/node_modules/bar.js\n\nThis allows programs to localize their dependencies, so that they do not\nclash.\nYou can require specific files or sub modules distributed with a module by\nincluding a path suffix after the module name. For instance\nrequire(&#39;example-module/path/to/file&#39;) would resolve path/to/file\nrelative to where example-module is located. The suffixed path follows the\nsame module resolution semantics.\nLoading from the global folders\n\nIf the NODE_PATH environment variable is set to a colon-delimited list\nof absolute paths, then Node.js will search those paths for modules if they\nare not found elsewhere.  (Note: On Windows, NODE_PATH is delimited by\nsemicolons instead of colons.)\nNODE_PATH was originally created to support loading modules from\nvarying paths before the current module resolution algorithm was frozen.\nNODE_PATH is still supported, but is less necessary now that the Node.js\necosystem has settled on a convention for locating dependent modules.\nSometimes deployments that rely on NODE_PATH show surprising behavior\nwhen people are unaware that NODE_PATH must be set.  Sometimes a\nmodule&#39;s dependencies change, causing a different version (or even a\ndifferent module) to be loaded as the NODE_PATH is searched.\nAdditionally, Node.js will search in the following locations:\n\n1: $HOME/.node_modules\n2: $HOME/.node_libraries\n3: $PREFIX/lib/node\n\nWhere $HOME is the user&#39;s home directory, and $PREFIX is Node.js&#39;s\nconfigured node_prefix.\nThese are mostly for historic reasons.  You are highly encouraged\nto place your dependencies locally in node_modules folders.  They\nwill be loaded faster, and more reliably.\nThe module wrapper\n\nBefore a module&#39;s code is executed, Node.js will wrap it with a function\nwrapper that looks like the following:\n(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {\n// Your module code actually lives in here\n});\n\nBy doing this, Node.js achieves a few things:\n\nIt keeps top-level variables (defined with var, const or let) scoped to\nthe module rather than the global object.\nIt helps to provide some global-looking variables that are actually specific\nto the module, such as:\nThe module and exports objects that the implementor can use to export\nvalues from the module.\nThe convenience variables __filename and __dirname, containing the\nmodule&#39;s absolute filename and directory path.\n\n\n\nThe module Object\n\n\n\n{Object}\n\nIn each module, the module free variable is a reference to the object\nrepresenting the current module.  For convenience, module.exports is\nalso accessible via the exports module-global. module isn&#39;t actually\na global but rather local to each module.\nmodule.children\n\n{Array}\n\nThe module objects required by this one.\nmodule.exports\n\n{Object}\n\nThe module.exports object is created by the Module system. Sometimes this is\nnot acceptable; many want their module to be an instance of some class. To do\nthis, assign the desired export object to module.exports. Note that assigning\nthe desired object to exports will simply rebind the local exports variable,\nwhich is probably not what you want to do.\nFor example suppose we were making a module called a.js\nconst EventEmitter = require(&#39;events&#39;);\n\nmodule.exports = new EventEmitter();\n\n// Do some work, and after some time emit\n// the &#39;ready&#39; event from the module itself.\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  module.exports.emit(&#39;ready&#39;);\n}, 1000);\n\nThen in another file we could do\nconst a = require(&#39;./a&#39;);\na.on(&#39;ready&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;module a is ready&#39;);\n});\n\nNote that assignment to module.exports must be done immediately. It cannot be\ndone in any callbacks.  This does not work:\nx.js:\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  module.exports = { a: &#39;hello&#39; };\n}, 0);\n\ny.js:\nconst x = require(&#39;./x&#39;);\nconsole.log(x.a);\n\nexports alias\nThe exports variable that is available within a module starts as a reference\nto module.exports. As with any variable, if you assign a new value to it, it\nis no longer bound to the previous value.\nTo illustrate the behavior, imagine this hypothetical implementation of\nrequire():\nfunction require(...) {\n  // ...\n  ((module, exports) =&gt; {\n    // Your module code here\n    exports = some_func;        // re-assigns exports, exports is no longer\n                                // a shortcut, and nothing is exported.\n    module.exports = some_func; // makes your module export 0\n  })(module, module.exports);\n  return module;\n}\n\nAs a guideline, if the relationship between exports and module.exports\nseems like magic to you, ignore exports and only use module.exports.\nmodule.filename\n\n{String}\n\nThe fully resolved filename to the module.\nmodule.id\n\n{String}\n\nThe identifier for the module.  Typically this is the fully resolved\nfilename.\nmodule.loaded\n\n{Boolean}\n\nWhether or not the module is done loading, or is in the process of\nloading.\nmodule.parent\n\n{Object} Module object\n\nThe module that first required this one.\nmodule.require(id)\n\nid {String}\nReturn: {Object} module.exports from the resolved module\n\nThe module.require method provides a way to load a module as if\nrequire() was called from the original module.\nNote that in order to do this, you must get a reference to the module\nobject.  Since require() returns the module.exports, and the module is\ntypically only available within a specific module&#39;s code, it must be\nexplicitly exported in order to be used.\n"},"net.html":{"url":"net.html","title":"Net","body":"title: net\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nnet\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe net module provides you with an asynchronous network wrapper. It contains\nfunctions for creating both servers and clients (called streams). You can include\nthis module with require(&#39;net&#39;);.\nClass: net.Server\n\nThis class is used to create a TCP or local server.\nnet.Server is an EventEmitter with the following events:\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nEmitted when the server closes. Note that if connections exist, this\nevent is not emitted until all connections are ended.\nEvent: &#39;connection&#39;\n\n\n{net.Socket} The connection object\n\nEmitted when a new connection is made. socket is an instance of\nnet.Socket.\nEvent: &#39;error&#39;\n\n\n{Error}\n\nEmitted when an error occurs.  The &#39;close&#39; event will be called directly\nfollowing this event.  See example in discussion of server.listen.\nEvent: &#39;listening&#39;\n\nEmitted when the server has been bound after calling server.listen.\nserver.address()\n\nReturns the bound address, the address family name, and port of the server\nas reported by the operating system.\nUseful to find which port was assigned when getting an OS-assigned address.\nReturns an object with port, family, and address properties:\n{ port: 12346, family: &#39;IPv4&#39;, address: &#39;127.0.0.1&#39; }\nExample:\nvar server = net.createServer((socket) =&gt; {\n  socket.end(&#39;goodbye\\n&#39;);\n}).on(&#39;error&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  // handle errors here\n  throw err;\n});\n\n// grab a random port.\nserver.listen(() =&gt; {\n  address = server.address();\n  console.log(&#39;opened server on %j&#39;, address);\n});\n\nDon&#39;t call server.address() until the &#39;listening&#39; event has been emitted.\nserver.close([callback])\n\nStops the server from accepting new connections and keeps existing\nconnections. This function is asynchronous, the server is finally\nclosed when all connections are ended and the server emits a &#39;close&#39; event.\nThe optional callback will be called once the &#39;close&#39; event occurs. Unlike\nthat event, it will be called with an Error as its only argument if the server\nwas not open when it was closed.\nserver.connections\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated: Use [`server.getConnections()`][] instead.\nThe number of concurrent connections on the server.\nThis becomes null when sending a socket to a child with\nchild_process.fork(). To poll forks and get current number of active\nconnections use asynchronous server.getConnections instead.\nserver.getConnections(callback)\n\nAsynchronously get the number of concurrent connections on the server. Works\nwhen sockets were sent to forks.\nCallback should take two arguments err and count.\nserver.listen(handle[, backlog][, callback])\n\n\nhandle {Object}\nbacklog {Number}\ncallback {Function}\n\nThe handle object can be set to either a server or socket (anything\nwith an underlying _handle member), or a {fd: &lt;n&gt;} object.\nThis will cause the server to accept connections on the specified\nhandle, but it is presumed that the file descriptor or handle has\nalready been bound to a port or domain socket.\nListening on a file descriptor is not supported on Windows.\nThis function is asynchronous.  When the server has been bound,\n&#39;listening&#39; event will be emitted.\nThe last parameter callback will be added as a listener for the\n&#39;listening&#39; event.\nThe parameter backlog behaves the same as in\nserver.listen(port[, hostname][, backlog][, callback]).\nserver.listen(options[, callback])\n\n\noptions {Object} - Required. Supports the following properties:\nport {Number} - Optional.\nhost {String} - Optional.\nbacklog {Number} - Optional.\npath {String} - Optional.\nexclusive {Boolean} - Optional.\n\n\ncallback {Function} - Optional.\n\nThe port, host, and backlog properties of options, as well as the\noptional callback function, behave as they do on a call to\nserver.listen(port[, hostname][, backlog][, callback]).\nAlternatively, the path option can be used to specify a UNIX socket.\nIf exclusive is false (default), then cluster workers will use the same\nunderlying handle, allowing connection handling duties to be shared. When\nexclusive is true, the handle is not shared, and attempted port sharing\nresults in an error. An example which listens on an exclusive port is\nshown below.\nserver.listen({\n  host: &#39;localhost&#39;,\n  port: 80,\n  exclusive: true\n});\n\nserver.listen(path[, backlog][, callback])\n\n\npath {String}\nbacklog {Number}\ncallback {Function}\n\nStart a local socket server listening for connections on the given path.\nThis function is asynchronous.  When the server has been bound,\n&#39;listening&#39; event will be emitted.  The last parameter callback\nwill be added as a listener for the &#39;listening&#39; event.\nOn UNIX, the local domain is usually known as the UNIX domain. The path is a\nfilesystem path name. It gets truncated to sizeof(sockaddr_un.sun_path)\nbytes, decreased by 1. It varies on different operating system between 91 and\n107 bytes. The typical values are 107 on Linux and 103 on OS X. The path is\nsubject to the same naming conventions and permissions checks as would be done\non file creation, will be visible in the filesystem, and will persist until\nunlinked.\nOn Windows, the local domain is implemented using a named pipe. The path must\nrefer to an entry in \\\\?\\pipe\\ or \\\\.\\pipe\\. Any characters are permitted,\nbut the latter may do some processing of pipe names, such as resolving ..\nsequences. Despite appearances, the pipe name space is flat.  Pipes will not\npersist, they are removed when the last reference to them is closed. Do not\nforget JavaScript string escaping requires paths to be specified with\ndouble-backslashes, such as:\nnet.createServer().listen(\n    path.join(&#39;\\\\\\\\?\\\\pipe&#39;, process.cwd(), &#39;myctl&#39;))\nThe parameter backlog behaves the same as in\nserver.listen(port[, hostname][, backlog][, callback]).\nserver.listen(port[, hostname][, backlog][, callback])\n\nBegin accepting connections on the specified port and hostname. If the\nhostname is omitted, the server will accept connections on any IPv6 address\n(::) when IPv6 is available, or any IPv4 address (0.0.0.0) otherwise. Use a\nport value of 0 to have the operating system assign an available port.\nBacklog is the maximum length of the queue of pending connections.\nThe actual length will be determined by the OS through sysctl settings such as\ntcp_max_syn_backlog and somaxconn on Linux. The default value of this\nparameter is 511 (not 512).\nThis function is asynchronous.  When the server has been bound,\n&#39;listening&#39; event will be emitted.  The last parameter callback\nwill be added as a listener for the &#39;listening&#39; event.\nOne issue some users run into is getting EADDRINUSE errors. This means that\nanother server is already running on the requested port. One way of handling this\nwould be to wait a second and then try again:\nserver.on(&#39;error&#39;, (e) =&gt; {\n  if (e.code == &#39;EADDRINUSE&#39;) {\n    console.log(&#39;Address in use, retrying...&#39;);\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n      server.close();\n      server.listen(PORT, HOST);\n    }, 1000);\n  }\n});\n\n(Note: All sockets in Node.js are set SO_REUSEADDR.)\nserver.listening\n\nA Boolean indicating whether or not the server is listening for\nconnections.\nserver.maxConnections\n\nSet this property to reject connections when the server&#39;s connection count gets\nhigh.\nIt is not recommended to use this option once a socket has been sent to a child\nwith child_process.fork().\nserver.ref()\n\nOpposite of unref, calling ref on a previously unrefd server will not\nlet the program exit if it&#39;s the only server left (the default behavior). If\nthe server is refd calling ref again will have no effect.\nReturns server.\nserver.unref()\n\nCalling unref on a server will allow the program to exit if this is the only\nactive server in the event system. If the server is already unrefd calling\nunref again will have no effect.\nReturns server.\nClass: net.Socket\n\nThis object is an abstraction of a TCP or local socket.  net.Socket\ninstances implement a duplex Stream interface.  They can be created by the\nuser and used as a client (with connect()) or they can be created by Node.js\nand passed to the user through the &#39;connection&#39; event of a server.\nnew net.Socket([options])\n\nConstruct a new socket object.\noptions is an object with the following defaults:\n{\n  fd: null,\n  allowHalfOpen: false,\n  readable: false,\n  writable: false\n}\n\nfd allows you to specify the existing file descriptor of socket.\nSet readable and/or writable to true to allow reads and/or writes on this\nsocket (NOTE: Works only when fd is passed).\nAbout allowHalfOpen, refer to createServer() and &#39;end&#39; event.\nnet.Socket instances are EventEmitter with the following events:\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\n\nhad_error {Boolean} true if the socket had a transmission error.\n\nEmitted once the socket is fully closed. The argument had_error is a boolean\nwhich says if the socket was closed due to a transmission error.\nEvent: &#39;connect&#39;\n\nEmitted when a socket connection is successfully established.\nSee connect().\nEvent: &#39;data&#39;\n\n\n{Buffer}\n\nEmitted when data is received.  The argument data will be a Buffer or\nString.  Encoding of data is set by socket.setEncoding().\n(See the Readable Stream section for more information.)\nNote that the data will be lost if there is no listener when a Socket\nemits a &#39;data&#39; event.\nEvent: &#39;drain&#39;\n\nEmitted when the write buffer becomes empty. Can be used to throttle uploads.\nSee also: the return values of socket.write()\nEvent: &#39;end&#39;\n\nEmitted when the other end of the socket sends a FIN packet.\nBy default (allowHalfOpen == false) the socket will destroy its file\ndescriptor  once it has written out its pending write queue.  However, by\nsetting allowHalfOpen == true the socket will not automatically end()\nits side allowing the user to write arbitrary amounts of data, with the\ncaveat that the user is required to end() their side now.\nEvent: &#39;error&#39;\n\n\n{Error}\n\nEmitted when an error occurs.  The &#39;close&#39; event will be called directly\nfollowing this event.\nEvent: &#39;lookup&#39;\n\nEmitted after resolving the hostname but before connecting.\nNot applicable to UNIX sockets.\n\nerr {Error|Null} The error object.  See dns.lookup().\naddress {String} The IP address.\nfamily {String|Null} The address type.  See dns.lookup().\nhost {String} The hostname.\n\nEvent: &#39;timeout&#39;\n\nEmitted if the socket times out from inactivity. This is only to notify that\nthe socket has been idle. The user must manually close the connection.\nSee also: socket.setTimeout()\nsocket.address()\n\nReturns the bound address, the address family name and port of the\nsocket as reported by the operating system. Returns an object with\nthree properties, e.g.\n{ port: 12346, family: &#39;IPv4&#39;, address: &#39;127.0.0.1&#39; }\nsocket.bufferSize\n\nnet.Socket has the property that socket.write() always works. This is to\nhelp users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up\nwith the amount of data that is written to a socket - the network connection\nsimply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a\nsocket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. (Internally it is\npolling on the socket&#39;s file descriptor for being writable).\nThe consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. This\nproperty shows the number of characters currently buffered to be written.\n(Number of characters is approximately equal to the number of bytes to be\nwritten, but the buffer may contain strings, and the strings are lazily\nencoded, so the exact number of bytes is not known.)\nUsers who experience large or growing bufferSize should attempt to\n&quot;throttle&quot; the data flows in their program with pause() and resume().\nsocket.bytesRead\n\nThe amount of received bytes.\nsocket.bytesWritten\n\nThe amount of bytes sent.\nsocket.connect(options[, connectListener])\n\nOpens the connection for a given socket.\nFor TCP sockets, options argument should be an object which specifies:\n\nport: Port the client should connect to (Required).\n\nhost: Host the client should connect to. Defaults to &#39;localhost&#39;.\n\nlocalAddress: Local interface to bind to for network connections.\n\nlocalPort: Local port to bind to for network connections.\n\nfamily : Version of IP stack. Defaults to 4.\n\nhints: dns.lookup() hints. Defaults to 0.\n\nlookup : Custom lookup function. Defaults to dns.lookup.\n\n\nFor local domain sockets, options argument should be an object which\nspecifies:\n\npath: Path the client should connect to (Required).\n\nNormally this method is not needed, as net.createConnection opens the\nsocket. Use this only if you are implementing a custom Socket.\nThis function is asynchronous. When the &#39;connect&#39; event is emitted the\nsocket is established. If there is a problem connecting, the &#39;connect&#39; event\nwill not be emitted, the &#39;error&#39; event will be emitted with the exception.\nThe connectListener parameter will be added as a listener for the\n&#39;connect&#39; event.\nsocket.connect(path[, connectListener])\nsocket.connect(port[, host][, connectListener])\n\nAs socket.connect(options[, connectListener]),\nwith options either as either {port: port, host: host} or {path: path}.\nsocket.connecting\n\nIf true - socket.connect(options[, connectListener]) was called and\nhaven&#39;t yet finished. Will be set to false before emitting connect event\nand/or calling socket.connect(options[, connectListener])&#39;s callback.\nsocket.destroy([exception])\n\nEnsures that no more I/O activity happens on this socket. Only necessary in\ncase of errors (parse error or so).\nIf exception is specified, an &#39;error&#39; event will be emitted and any\nlisteners for that event will receive exception as an argument.\nsocket.destroyed\nA Boolean value that indicates if the connection is destroyed or not. Once a\nconnection is destroyed no further data can be transferred using it.\nsocket.end([data][, encoding])\n\nHalf-closes the socket. i.e., it sends a FIN packet. It is possible the\nserver will still send some data.\nIf data is specified, it is equivalent to calling\nsocket.write(data, encoding) followed by socket.end().\nsocket.localAddress\n\nThe string representation of the local IP address the remote client is\nconnecting on. For example, if you are listening on &#39;0.0.0.0&#39; and the\nclient connects on &#39;192.168.1.1&#39;, the value would be &#39;192.168.1.1&#39;.\nsocket.localPort\n\nThe numeric representation of the local port. For example,\n80 or 21.\nsocket.pause()\nPauses the reading of data. That is, &#39;data&#39; events will not be emitted.\nUseful to throttle back an upload.\nsocket.ref()\n\nOpposite of unref, calling ref on a previously unrefd socket will not\nlet the program exit if it&#39;s the only socket left (the default behavior). If\nthe socket is refd calling ref again will have no effect.\nReturns socket.\nsocket.remoteAddress\n\nThe string representation of the remote IP address. For example,\n&#39;74.125.127.100&#39; or &#39;2001:4860:a005::68&#39;. Value may be undefined if\nthe socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).\nsocket.remoteFamily\n\nThe string representation of the remote IP family. &#39;IPv4&#39; or &#39;IPv6&#39;.\nsocket.remotePort\n\nThe numeric representation of the remote port. For example,\n80 or 21.\nsocket.resume()\nResumes reading after a call to pause().\nsocket.setEncoding([encoding])\n\nSet the encoding for the socket as a Readable Stream. See\nstream.setEncoding() for more information.\nsocket.setKeepAlive([enable][, initialDelay])\n\nEnable/disable keep-alive functionality, and optionally set the initial\ndelay before the first keepalive probe is sent on an idle socket.\nenable defaults to false.\nSet initialDelay (in milliseconds) to set the delay between the last\ndata packet received and the first keepalive probe. Setting 0 for\ninitialDelay will leave the value unchanged from the default\n(or previous) setting. Defaults to 0.\nReturns socket.\nsocket.setNoDelay([noDelay])\n\nDisables the Nagle algorithm. By default TCP connections use the Nagle\nalgorithm, they buffer data before sending it off. Setting true for\nnoDelay will immediately fire off data each time socket.write() is called.\nnoDelay defaults to true.\nReturns socket.\nsocket.setTimeout(timeout[, callback])\n\nSets the socket to timeout after timeout milliseconds of inactivity on\nthe socket. By default net.Socket do not have a timeout.\nWhen an idle timeout is triggered the socket will receive a &#39;timeout&#39;\nevent but the connection will not be severed. The user must manually end()\nor destroy() the socket.\nIf timeout is 0, then the existing idle timeout is disabled.\nThe optional callback parameter will be added as a one time listener for the\n&#39;timeout&#39; event.\nReturns socket.\nsocket.unref()\n\nCalling unref on a socket will allow the program to exit if this is the only\nactive socket in the event system.

The connectionListener argument is\nautomatically set as a listener for the &#39;connection&#39; event.\noptions is an object with the following defaults:\n{\n  allowHalfOpen: false,\n  pauseOnConnect: false\n}\n\nIf allowHalfOpen is true, then the socket won&#39;t automatically send a FIN\npacket when the other end of the socket sends a FIN packet. The socket becomes\nnon-readable, but still writable. You should call the end() method explicitly.\nSee &#39;end&#39; event for more information.\nIf pauseOnConnect is true, then the socket associated with each incoming\nconnection will be paused, and no data will be read from its handle. This allows\nconnections to be passed between processes without any data being read by the\noriginal process. To begin reading data from a paused socket, call resume().\nHere is an example of an echo server which listens for connections\non port 8124:\nconst net = require(&#39;net&#39;);\nconst server = net.createServer((c) =&gt; {\n  // &#39;connection&#39; listener\n  console.log(&#39;client connected&#39;);\n  c.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;client disconnected&#39;);\n  });\n  c.write(&#39;hello\\r\\n&#39;);\n  c.pipe(c);\n});\nserver.on(&#39;error&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  throw err;\n});\nserver.listen(8124, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;server bound&#39;);\n});\n\nTest this by using telnet:\ntelnet localhost 8124\n\nTo listen on the socket /tmp/echo.sock the third line from the last would\njust be changed to\nserver.listen(&#39;/tmp/echo.sock&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;server bound&#39;);\n});\n\nUse nc to connect to a UNIX domain socket server:\nnc -U /tmp/echo.sock\n\nnet.isIP(input)\n\nTests if input is an IP address.

and directory paths.\nIt can be accessed using:\nconst path = require(&#39;path&#39;);\n\nWindows vs. POSIX\nThe default operation of the path module varies based on the operating system\non which a Node.js application is running. Specifically, when running on a\nWindows operating system, the path module will assume that Windows-style\npaths are being used.\nFor example, using the path.basename() function with the Windows file path\nC:\\temp\\myfile.html, will yield different results when running on POSIX than\nwhen run on Windows:\nOn POSIX:\npath.basename(&#39;C:\\\\temp\\\\myfile.html&#39;);\n  // returns &#39;C:\\temp\\myfile.html&#39;\n\nOn Windows:\npath.basename(&#39;C:\\\\temp\\\\myfile.html&#39;);\n  // returns &#39;myfile.html&#39;\n\nTo achieve consistent results when working with Windows file paths on any\noperating system, use path.win32:\nOn POSIX and Windows:\npath.win32.basename(&#39;C:\\\\temp\\\\myfile.html&#39;);\n  // returns &#39;myfile.html&#39;\n\nTo achieve consistent results when working with POSIX file paths on any\noperating system, use path.posix:\nOn POSIX and Windows:\npath.posix.basename(&#39;/tmp/myfile.html&#39;);\n  // returns &#39;myfile.html&#39;\n\npath.basename(path[, ext])\n\n\npath {String}\next {String} An optional file extension\n\nThe path.basename() methods returns the last portion of a path, similar to\nthe Unix basename command.\nFor example:\npath.basename(&#39;/foo/bar/baz/asdf/quux.html&#39;)\n  // returns &#39;quux.html&#39;\n\npath.basename(&#39;/foo/bar/baz/asdf/quux.html&#39;, &#39;.html&#39;)\n  // returns &#39;quux&#39;\n\nA TypeError is thrown if path is not a string or if ext is given\nand is not a string.\npath.delimiter\n\nProvides the platform-specific path delimiter:\n\n; for Windows\n: for POSIX\n\nFor example, on POSIX:\nconsole.log(process.env.PATH)\n// &#39;/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin&#39;\n\nprocess.env.PATH.split(path.delimiter)\n// returns [&#39;/usr/bin&#39;, &#39;/bin&#39;, &#39;/usr/sbin&#39;, &#39;/sbin&#39;, &#39;/usr/local/bin&#39;]\n\nOn Windows:\nconsole.log(process.env.PATH)\n// &#39;C:\\Windows\\system32;C:\\Windows;C:\\Program Files\\node\\&#39;\n\nprocess.env.PATH.split(path.delimiter)\n// returns [&#39;C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32&#39;, &#39;C:\\\\Windows&#39;, &#39;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\node\\\\&#39;]\n\npath.dirname(path)\n\n\npath {String}\n\nThe path.dirname() method returns the directory name of a path, similar to\nthe Unix dirname command.\nFor example:\npath.dirname(&#39;/foo/bar/baz/asdf/quux&#39;)\n// returns &#39;/foo/bar/baz/asdf&#39;\n\nA TypeError is thrown if path is not a string.\npath.extname(path)\n\n\npath {String}\n\nThe path.extname() method returns the extension of the path, from the last\noccurance of the . (period) character to end of string in the last portion of\nthe path.  If there is no . in the last portion of the path, or if the\nfirst character of the basename of path (see path.basename()) is ., then\nan empty string is returned.\nFor example:\npath.extname(&#39;index.html&#39;)\n// returns &#39;.html&#39;\n\npath.extname(&#39;index.coffee.md&#39;)\n// returns &#39;.md&#39;\n\npath.extname(&#39;index.&#39;)\n// returns &#39;.&#39;\n\npath.extname(&#39;index&#39;)\n// returns &#39;&#39;\n\npath.extname(&#39;.index&#39;)\n// returns &#39;&#39;\n\nA TypeError is thrown if path is not a string.\npath.format(pathObject)\n\n\npathObject {Object}\ndir {String}\nroot {String} \nbase {String}\nname {String}\next {String}\n\n\n\nThe path.format() method returns a path string from an object. This is the\nopposite of path.parse().\nThe following process is used when constructing the path string:\n\noutput is set to an empty string.\nIf pathObject.dir is specified, pathObject.dir is appended to output\nfollowed by the value of path.sep;\nOtherwise, if pathObject.root is specified, pathObject.root is appended\nto output.\nIf pathObject.base is specified, pathObject.base is appended to output;\nOtherwise:\nIf pathObject.name is specified, pathObject.name is appended to output\nIf pathObject.ext is specified, pathObject.ext is appended to output.\n\n\nReturn output\n\nFor example, on POSIX:\n// If `dir` and `base` are provided,\n// `${dir}${path.sep}${base}`\n// will be returned.\npath.format({\n  dir: &#39;/home/user/dir&#39;,\n  base: &#39;file.txt&#39;\n});\n// returns &#39;/home/user/dir/file.txt&#39;\n\n// `root` will be used if `dir` is not specified.\n// If only `root` is provided or `dir` is equal to `root` then the\n// platform separator will not be included.\npath.format({\n  root: &#39;/&#39;,\n  base: &#39;file.txt&#39;\n});\n// returns &#39;/file.txt&#39;\n\n// `name` + `ext` will be used if `base` is not specified.\npath.format({\n  root: &#39;/&#39;,\n  name: &#39;file&#39;,\n  ext: &#39;.txt&#39;\n});\n// returns &#39;/file.txt&#39;\n\n// `base` will be returned if `dir` or `root` are not provided.\npath.format({\n  base: &#39;file.txt&#39;\n});\n// returns &#39;file.txt&#39;\n\nOn Windows:\npath.format({\n    root : &quot;C:\\\\&quot;,\n    dir : &quot;C:\\\\path\\\\dir&quot;,\n    base : &quot;file.txt&quot;,\n    ext : &quot;.txt&quot;,\n    name : &quot;file&quot;\n});\n// returns &#39;C:\\\\path\\\\dir\\\\file.txt&#39;\n\npath.isAbsolute(path)\n\n\npath {String}\n\nThe path.isAbsolute() method determines if path is an absolute path.\nIf the given path is a zero-length string, false will be returned.\nFor example on POSIX:\npath.isAbsolute(&#39;/foo/bar&#39;) // true\npath.isAbsolute(&#39;/baz/..&#39;)  // true\npath.isAbsolute(&#39;qux/&#39;)     // false\npath.isAbsolute(&#39;.&#39;)        // false\n\nOn Windows:\npath.isAbsolute(&#39;//server&#39;)  // true\npath.isAbsolute(&#39;C:/foo/..&#39;) // true\npath.isAbsolute(&#39;bar\\\\baz&#39;)  // false\npath.isAbsolute(&#39;.&#39;)         // false\n\nA TypeError is thrown if path is not a string.\npath.join([path[, ...]])\n\n\n[path[, ...]] {String} A sequence of path segments\n\nThe path.join() method join all given path segments together using the\nplatform specific separator as a delimiter, then normalizes the resulting path.\nZero-length path segments are ignored. If the joined path string is a\nzero-length string then &#39;.&#39; will be returned, representing the current\nworking directory.\nFor example:\npath.join(&#39;/foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;baz/asdf&#39;, &#39;quux&#39;, &#39;..&#39;)\n// returns &#39;/foo/bar/baz/asdf&#39;\n\npath.join(&#39;foo&#39;, {}, &#39;bar&#39;)\n// throws TypeError: Arguments to path.join must be strings\n\nA TypeError is thrown if any of the path segments is not a string.\npath.normalize(path)\n\n\npath {String}\n\nThe path.normalize() method normalizes the given path, resolving &#39;..&#39; and\n&#39;.&#39; segments.\nWhen multiple, sequential path segment separation characters are found (e.g.\n/ on POSIX and \\ on Windows), they are replaced by a single instance of the\nplatform specific path segment separator. Trailing separators are preserved.\nIf the path is a zero-length string, &#39;.&#39; is returned, representing the\ncurrent working directory.\nFor example on POSIX:\npath.normalize(&#39;/foo/bar//baz/asdf/quux/..&#39;)\n// returns &#39;/foo/bar/baz/asdf&#39;\n\nOn Windows:\npath.normalize(&#39;C:\\\\temp\\\\\\\\foo\\\\bar\\\\..\\\\&#39;);\n// returns &#39;C:\\\\temp\\\\foo\\\\&#39;\n\nA TypeError is thrown if path is not a string.\npath.parse(path)\n\n\npath {String}\n\nThe path.parse() method returns an object whose properties represent\nsignificant elements of the path.\nThe returned object will have the following properties:\n\nroot {String}\ndir {String}\nbase {String}\next {String}\nname {String}\n\nFor example on POSIX:\npath.parse(&#39;/home/user/dir/file.txt&#39;)\n// returns\n// {\n//    root : &quot;/&quot;,\n//    dir : &quot;/home/user/dir&quot;,\n//    base : &quot;file.txt&quot;,\n//    ext : &quot;.txt&quot;,\n//    name : &quot;file&quot;\n// }\n\n┌─────────────────────┬────────────┐\n│          dir        │    base    │\n├──────┬              ├──────┬─────┤\n│ root │              │ name │ ext │\n&quot;  /    home/user/dir / file  .txt &quot;\n└──────┴──────────────┴──────┴─────┘\n(all spaces in the &quot;&quot; line should be ignored -- they are purely for formatting)\n\nOn Windows:\npath.parse(&#39;C:\\\\path\\\\dir\\\\file.txt&#39;)\n// returns\n// {\n//    root : &quot;C:\\\\&quot;,\n//    dir : &quot;C:\\\\path\\\\dir&quot;,\n//    base : &quot;file.txt&quot;,\n//    ext : &quot;.txt&quot;,\n//    name : &quot;file&quot;\n// }\n\n┌─────────────────────┬────────────┐\n│          dir        │    base    │\n├──────┬              ├──────┬─────┤\n│ root │              │ name │ ext │\n&quot; C:\\      path\\dir   \\ file  .txt &quot;\n└──────┴──────────────┴──────┴─────┘\n(all spaces in the &quot;&quot; line should be ignored -- they are purely for formatting)\n\nA TypeError is thrown if path is not a string.\npath.posix\n\nThe path.posix property provides access to POSIX specific implementations\nof the path methods.\npath.relative(from, to)\n\n\nfrom {String}\nto {String}\n\nThe path.relative() method returns the relative path from from to to.\nIf from and to each resolve to the same path (after calling path.resolve()\non each), a zero-length string is returned.\nIf a zero-length string is passed as from or to, the current working\ndirectory will be used instead of the zero-length strings.\nFor example on POSIX:\npath.relative(&#39;/data/orandea/test/aaa&#39;, &#39;/data/orandea/impl/bbb&#39;)\n// returns &#39;../../impl/bbb&#39;\n\nOn Windows:\npath.relative(&#39;C:\\\\orandea\\\\test\\\\aaa&#39;, &#39;C:\\\\orandea\\\\impl\\\\bbb&#39;)\n// returns &#39;..\\\\..\\\\impl\\\\bbb&#39;\n\nA TypeError is thrown if neither from nor to is a string.\npath.resolve([path[, ...]])\n\n\n[path[, ...]] {String} A sequence of paths or path segments\n\nThe path.resolve() method resolves a sequence of paths or path segments into\nan absolute path.\nThe given sequence of paths is processed from right to left, with each\nsubsequent path prepended until an absolute path is constructed.\nFor instance, given the sequence of path segments: /foo, /bar, baz,\ncalling path.resolve(&#39;/foo&#39;, &#39;/bar&#39;, &#39;baz&#39;) would return /bar/baz.\nIf after processing all given path segments an absolute path has not yet\nbeen generated, the current working directory is used.\nThe resulting path is normalized and trailing slashes are removed unless the\npath is resolved to the root directory.\nZero-length path segments are ignored.\nIf no path segments are passed, path.resolve() will return the absolute path\nof the current working directory.\nFor example:\npath.resolve(&#39;/foo/bar&#39;, &#39;./baz&#39;)\n// returns &#39;/foo/bar/baz&#39;\n\npath.resolve(&#39;/foo/bar&#39;, &#39;/tmp/file/&#39;)\n// returns &#39;/tmp/file&#39;\n\npath.resolve(&#39;wwwroot&#39;, &#39;static_files/png/&#39;, &#39;../gif/image.gif&#39;)\n// if the current working directory is /home/myself/node,\n// this returns &#39;/home/myself/node/wwwroot/static_files/gif/image.gif&#39;\n\nA TypeError is thrown if any of the arguments is not a string.\npath.sep\n\nProvides the platform-specific path segment separator:\n\n\\ on Windows\n/ on POSIX\n\nFor example on POSIX:\n&#39;foo/bar/baz&#39;.split(path.sep)\n// returns [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;baz&#39;]\n\nOn Windows:\n&#39;foo\\\\bar\\\\baz&#39;.split(path.sep)\n// returns [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;baz&#39;]\n\npath.win32\n\nThe path.win32 property provides access to Windows-specific implementations\nof the path methods.\n"},"process.html":{"url":"process.html","title":"Process","body":"title: process\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nprocess\n\nThe process object is a global that provides information about, and control\nover, the current Node.js process. As a global, it is always available to\nNode.js applications without using require().\nProcess Events\nThe process object is an instance of EventEmitter.\nEvent: &#39;beforeExit&#39;\n\nThe &#39;beforeExit&#39; event is emitted when Node.js empties its event loop and has\nno additional work to schedule. Normally, the Node.js process will exit when\nthere is no work scheduled, but a listener registered on the &#39;beforeExit&#39;\nevent can make asynchronous calls, and thereby cause the Node.js process to\ncontinue.\nThe listener callback function is invoked with the value of\n[process.exitCode][] passed as the only argument.\nThe &#39;beforeExit&#39; event is not emitted for conditions causing explicit\ntermination, such as calling process.exit() or uncaught exceptions.\nThe &#39;beforeExit&#39; should not be used as an alternative to the &#39;exit&#39; event\nunless the intention is to schedule additional work.\nEvent: &#39;disconnect&#39;\n\nIf the Node.js process is spawned with an IPC channel (see the Child Process\nand Cluster documentation), the &#39;disconnect&#39; event will be emitted when\nthe IPC channel is closed.\nEvent: &#39;exit&#39;\n\nThe &#39;exit&#39; event is emitted when the Node.js process is about to exit as a\nresult of either:\n\nThe process.exit() method being called explicitly;\nThe Node.js event loop no longer having any additional work to perform.\n\nThere is no way to prevent the exiting of the event loop at this point, and once\nall &#39;exit&#39; listeners have finished running the Node.js process will terminate.\nThe listener callback function is invoked with the exit code specified either\nby the [process.exitCode][] property, or the exitCode argument passed to the\nprocess.exit() method, as the only argument.\nFor example:\nprocess.on(&#39;exit&#39;, (code) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`About to exit with code: ${code}`);\n});\n\nListener functions must only perform synchronous operations. The Node.js\nprocess will exit immediately after calling the &#39;exit&#39; event listeners\ncausing any additional work still queued in the event loop to be abandoned.\nIn the following example, for instance, the timeout will never occur:\nprocess.on(&#39;exit&#39;, (code) =&gt; {\n  setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;This will not run&#39;);\n  }, 0);\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;message&#39;\n\nIf the Node.js process is spawned with an IPC channel (see the Child Process\nand Cluster documentation), the &#39;message&#39; event is emitted whenever a\nmessage sent by a parent process using childprocess.send() is received by\nthe child process.\nThe listener callback is invoked with the following arguments:\n\nmessage {Object} a parsed JSON object or primitive value\nsendHandle {Handle object} a net.Socket or net.Server object, or\nundefined.\n\nEvent: &#39;rejectionHandled&#39;\n\nThe &#39;rejectionHandled&#39; event is emitted whenever a Promise has been rejected\nand an error handler was attached to it (using promise.catch(), for\nexample) later than one turn of the Node.js event loop.\nThe listener callback is invoked with a reference to the rejected Promise as\nthe only argument.\nThe Promise object would have previously been emitted in an\n&#39;unhandledRejection&#39; event, but during the course of processing gained a\nrejection handler.\nThere is no notion of a top level for a Promise chain at which rejections can\nalways be handled. Being inherently asynchronous in nature, a Promise\nrejection can be handled at a future point in time — possibly much later than\nthe event loop turn it takes for the &#39;unhandledRejection&#39; event to be emitted.\nAnother way of stating this is that, unlike in synchronous code where there is\nan ever-growing list of unhandled exceptions, with Promises there can be a\ngrowing-and-shrinking list of unhandled rejections.\nIn synchronous code, the &#39;uncaughtException&#39; event is emitted when the list of\nunhandled exceptions grows.\nIn asynchronous code, the &#39;unhandledRejection&#39; event is emitted when the list\nof unhandled rejections grows, and the &#39;rejectionHandled&#39; event is emitted\nwhen the list of unhandled rejections shrinks.\nFor example:\nconst unhandledRejections = new Map();\nprocess.on(&#39;unhandledRejection&#39;, (reason, p) =&gt; {\n  unhandledRejections.set(p, reason);\n});\nprocess.on(&#39;rejectionHandled&#39;, (p) =&gt; {\n  unhandledRejections.delete(p);\n});\n\nIn this example, the unhandledRejections Map will grow and shrink over time,\nreflecting rejections that start unhandled and then become handled. It is\npossible to record such errors in an error log, either periodically (which is\nlikely best for long-running application) or upon process exit (which is likely\nmost convenient for scripts).\nEvent: &#39;uncaughtException&#39;\n\nThe &#39;uncaughtException&#39; event is emitted when an uncaught JavaScript\nexception bubbles all the way back to the event loop. By default, Node.js\nhandles such exceptions by printing the stack trace to stderr and exiting.\nAdding a handler for the &#39;uncaughtException&#39; event overrides this default\nbehavior.\nThe listener function is called with the Error object passed as the only\nargument.\nFor example:\nprocess.on(&#39;uncaughtException&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  fs.writeSync(1, `Caught exception: ${err}`);\n});\n\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;This will still run.&#39;);\n}, 500);\n\n// Intentionally cause an exception, but don&#39;t catch it.\nnonexistentFunc();\nconsole.log(&#39;This will not run.&#39;);\n\nWarning: Using &#39;uncaughtException&#39; correctly\nNote that &#39;uncaughtException&#39; is a crude mechanism for exception handling\nintended to be used only as a last resort. The event should not be used as\nan equivalent to On Error Resume Next. Unhandled exceptions inherently mean\nthat an application is in an undefined state. Attempting to resume application\ncode without properly recovering from the exception can cause additional\nunforeseen and unpredictable issues.\nExceptions thrown from within the event handler will not be caught. Instead the\nprocess will exit with a non-zero exit code and the stack trace will be printed.\nThis is to avoid infinite recursion.\nAttempting to resume normally after an uncaught exception can be similar to\npulling out of the power cord when upgrading a computer -- nine out of ten\ntimes nothing happens - but the 10th time, the system becomes corrupted.\nThe correct use of &#39;uncaughtException&#39; is to perform synchronous cleanup\nof allocated resources (e.g. file descriptors, handles, etc) before shutting\ndown the process. It is not safe to resume normal operation after\n&#39;uncaughtException&#39;.\nTo restart a crashed application in a more reliable way, whether uncaughtException\nis emitted or not, an external monitor should be employed in a separate process\nto detect application failures and recover or restart as needed.\nEvent: &#39;unhandledRejection&#39;\n\nThe &#39;unhandledRejection&#39; event is emitted whenever a Promise is rejected and\nno error handler is attached to the promise within a turn of the event loop.\nWhen programming with Promises, exceptions are encapsulated as &quot;rejected\npromises&quot;. Rejections can be caught and handled using promise.catch() and\nare propagated through a Promise chain. The &#39;unhandledRejection&#39; event is\nuseful for detecting and keeping track of promises that were rejected whose\nrejections have not yet been handled.\nThe listener function is called with the following arguments:\n\nreason {Error|any} The object with which the promise was rejected\n(typically an Error objet).\np the Promise that was rejected.\n\nFor example:\nprocess.on(&#39;unhandledRejection&#39;, (reason, p) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Unhandled Rejection at: Promise&#39;, p, &#39;reason:&#39;, reason);\n  // application specific logging, throwing an error, or other logic here\n});\n\nsomePromise.then((res) =&gt; {\n  return reportToUser(JSON.pasre(res)); // note the typo (`pasre`)\n}); // no `.catch` or `.then`\n\nThe following will also trigger the &#39;unhandledRejection&#39; event to be\nemitted:\nfunction SomeResource() {\n  // Initially set the loaded status to a rejected promise\n  this.loaded = Promise.reject(new Error(&#39;Resource not yet loaded!&#39;));\n}\n\nvar resource = new SomeResource();\n// no .catch or .then on resource.loaded for at least a turn\n\nIn this example case, it is possible to track the rejection as a developer error\nas would typically be the case for other &#39;unhandledRejection&#39; events. To\naddress such failures, a non-operational\n.catch(() =&gt; { }) handler may be attached to\nresource.loaded, which would prevent the &#39;unhandledRejection&#39; event from\nbeing emitted. Alternatively, the &#39;rejectionHandled&#39; event may be used.\nEvent: &#39;warning&#39;\n\nThe &#39;warning&#39; event is emitted whenever Node.js emits a process warning.\nA process warning is similar to an error in that it describes exceptional\nconditions that are being brought to the user&#39;s attention. However, warnings\nare not part of the normal Node.js and JavaScript error handling flow.\nNode.js can emit warnings whenever it detects bad coding practices that could\nlead to sub-optimal application performance, bugs or security vulnerabilities.\nThe listener function is called with a single warning argument whose value is\nan Error object. There are three key properties that describe the warning:\n\nname {String} The name of the warning (currently Warning by default).\nmessage {String} A system-provided description of the warning.\nstack {String} A stack trace to the location in the code where the warning\nwas issued.\n\nprocess.on(&#39;warning&#39;, (warning) =&gt; {\n  console.warn(warning.name);    // Print the warning name\n  console.warn(warning.message); // Print the warning message\n  console.warn(warning.stack);   // Print the stack trace\n});\n\nBy default, Node.js will print process warnings to stderr. The --no-warnings\ncommand-line option can be used to suppress the default console output but the\n&#39;warning&#39; event will still be emitted by the process object.\nThe following example illustrates the warning that is printed to stderr when\ntoo many listeners have been added to an event\n$ node\n&gt; event.defaultMaxListeners = 1;\n&gt; process.on(&#39;foo&#39;, () =&gt; {});\n&gt; process.on(&#39;foo&#39;, () =&gt; {});\n&gt; (node:38638) Warning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 2 foo\n... listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit\n\nIn contrast, the following example turns off the default warning output and\nadds a custom handler to the &#39;warning&#39; event:\n$ node --no-warnings\n&gt; var p = process.on(&#39;warning&#39;, (warning) =&gt; console.warn(&#39;Do not do that!&#39;));\n&gt; event.defaultMaxListeners = 1;\n&gt; process.on(&#39;foo&#39;, () =&gt; {});\n&gt; process.on(&#39;foo&#39;, () =&gt; {});\n&gt; Do not do that!\n\nThe --trace-warnings command-line option can be used to have the default\nconsole output for warnings include the full stack trace of the warning.\nEmitting custom warnings\nThe process.emitWarning() method can be used to issue\ncustom or application specific warnings.\n// Emit a warning using a string...\nprocess.emitWarning(&#39;Something happened!&#39;);\n  // Prints: (node 12345) Warning: Something happened!\n\n// Emit a warning using an object...\nprocess.emitWarning(&#39;Something Happened!&#39;, &#39;CustomWarning&#39;);\n  // Prints: (node 12345) CustomWarning: Something happened!\n\n// Emit a warning using a custom Error object...\nclass CustomWarning extends Error {\n  constructor(message) {\n    super(message);\n    this.name = &#39;CustomWarning&#39;;\n    Error.captureStackTrace(this, CustomWarning);\n  }\n}\nconst myWarning = new CustomWarning(&#39;Something happened!&#39;);\nprocess.emitWarning(myWarning);\n  // Prints: (node 12345) CustomWarning: Something happened!\n\nEmitting custom deprecation warnings\nCustom deprecation warnings can be emitted by setting the name of a custom\nwarning to DeprecationWarning. For instance:\nprocess.emitWarning(&#39;This API is deprecated&#39;, &#39;DeprecationWarning&#39;);\n\nOr,\nconst err = new Error(&#39;This API is deprecated&#39;);\nerr.name = &#39;DeprecationWarning&#39;;\nprocess.emitWarning(err);\n\nLaunching Node.js using the --throw-deprecation command line flag will\ncause custom deprecation warnings to be thrown as exceptions.\nUsing the --trace-deprecation command line flag will cause the custom\ndeprecation to be printed to stderr along with the stack trace.\nUsing the --no-deprecation command line flag will suppress all reporting\nof the custom deprecation.\nThe *-deprecation command line flags only affect warnings that use the name\nDeprecationWarning.\nSignal Events\n\n\nSignal events will be emitted when the Node.js process receives a signal. Please\nrefer to sigaction(2) for a listing of standard POSIX signal names such as\nSIGINT, SIGHUP, etc.\nThe name of each event will be the uppercase common name for the signal (e.g.\n&#39;SIGINT&#39; for SIGINT signals).\nFor example:\n// Begin reading from stdin so the process does not exit.\nprocess.stdin.resume();\n\nprocess.on(&#39;SIGINT&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Received SIGINT.  Press Control-D to exit.&#39;);\n});\n\nNote: An easy way to send the SIGINT signal is with &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C in most\nterminal programs.\nIt is important to take note of the following:\n\nSIGUSR1 is reserved by Node.js to start the debugger.  It&#39;s possible to\ninstall a listener but doing so will not stop the debugger from starting.\nSIGTERM and SIGINT have default handlers on non-Windows platforms that\nresets the terminal mode before exiting with code 128 + signal number. If\none of these signals has a listener installed, its default behavior will be\nremoved (Node.js will no longer exit).\nSIGPIPE is ignored by default. It can have a listener installed.\nSIGHUP is generated on Windows when the console window is closed, and on\nother platforms under various similar conditions, see signal(7). It can have a\nlistener installed, however Node.js will be unconditionally terminated by\nWindows about 10 seconds later. On non-Windows platforms, the default\nbehavior of SIGHUP is to terminate Node.js, but once a listener has been\ninstalled its default behavior will be removed.\nSIGTERM is not supported on Windows, it can be listened on.\nSIGINT from the terminal is supported on all platforms, and can usually be\ngenerated with CTRL+C (though this may be configurable). It is not generated\nwhen terminal raw mode is enabled.\nSIGBREAK is delivered on Windows when &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Break&gt; is pressed, on\nnon-Windows platforms it can be listened on, but there is no way to send or\ngenerate it.\nSIGWINCH is delivered when the console has been resized. On Windows, this\nwill only happen on write to the console when the cursor is being moved, or\nwhen a readable tty is used in raw mode.\nSIGKILL cannot have a listener installed, it will unconditionally terminate\nNode.js on all platforms.\nSIGSTOP cannot have a listener installed.\n\nNote: Windows does not support sending signals, but Node.js offers some\nemulation with process.kill(), and ChildProcess.kill(). Sending\nsignal 0 can be used to test for the existence of a process. Sending SIGINT,\nSIGTERM, and SIGKILL cause the unconditional termination of the target\nprocess.\nprocess.abort()\n\nThe process.abort() method causes the Node.js process to exit immediately and\ngenerate a core file.\nprocess.arch\n\nThe process.arch property returns a String identifying the processor\narchitecture that the Node.js process is currently running on. For instance\n&#39;arm&#39;, &#39;ia32&#39;, or &#39;x64&#39;.\nconsole.log(`This processor architecture is ${process.arch}`);\n\nprocess.argv\n\nThe process.argv property returns an array containing the command line\narguments passed when the Node.js process was launched. The first element will\nbe process.execPath. The second element will be the path to the\nJavaScript file being executed. The remaining elements will be any additional\ncommand line arguments.\nFor example, assuming the following script for process-args.js:\n// print process.argv\nprocess.argv.forEach((val, index) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`${index}: ${val}`);\n});\n\nLaunching the Node.js process as:\n$ node process-2.js one two=three four\n\nWould generate the output:\n0: /usr/local/bin/node\n1: /Users/mjr/work/node/process-2.js\n2: one\n3: two=three\n4: four\n\nprocess.chdir(directory)\n\n\ndirectory {String}\n\nThe process.chdir() method changes the current working directory of the\nNode.js process or throws an exception if doing so fails (for instance, if\nthe specified directory does not exist).\nconsole.log(`Starting directory: ${process.cwd()}`);\ntry {\n  process.chdir(&#39;/tmp&#39;);\n  console.log(`New directory: ${process.cwd()}`);\n}\ncatch (err) {\n  console.log(`chdir: ${err}`);\n}\n\nprocess.config\n\nThe process.config property returns an Object containing the JavaScript\nrepresentation of the configure options used to compile the current Node.js\nexecutable. This is the same as the config.gypi file that was produced when\nrunning the ./configure script.\nAn example of the possible output looks like:\n{\n  target_defaults:\n   { cflags: [],\n     default_configuration: &#39;Release&#39;,\n     defines: [],\n     include_dirs: [],\n     libraries: [] },\n  variables:\n   {\n     host_arch: &#39;x64&#39;,\n     node_install_npm: &#39;true&#39;,\n     node_prefix: &#39;&#39;,\n     node_shared_cares: &#39;false&#39;,\n     node_shared_http_parser: &#39;false&#39;,\n     node_shared_libuv: &#39;false&#39;,\n     node_shared_zlib: &#39;false&#39;,\n     node_use_dtrace: &#39;false&#39;,\n     node_use_openssl: &#39;true&#39;,\n     node_shared_openssl: &#39;false&#39;,\n     strict_aliasing: &#39;true&#39;,\n     target_arch: &#39;x64&#39;,\n     v8_use_snapshot: &#39;true&#39;\n   }\n}\n\nNote: The process.config property is not read-only and there are\nexisting modules in the ecosystem that are known to extend, modify, or entirely\nreplace the value of process.config.\nprocess.connected\n\nIf the Node.js process is spawned with an IPC channel (see the Child Process\nand Cluster documentation), the process.connected property will return\ntrue so long as the IPC channel is connected and will return false after\nprocess.disconnect() is called.\nOnce process.connected is false, it is no longer possible to send messages\nover the IPC channel using process.send().\nprocess.cpuUsage([previousValue])\n\n\npreviousValue {Array} A previous return value from calling\nprocess.cpuUsage()\n\nThe process.cpuUsage() method returns the user and system CPU time usage of\nthe current process, in an object with properties user and system, whose\nvalues are microsecond values (millionth of a second). These values measure time\nspent in user and system code respectively, and may end up being greater than\nactual elapsed time if multiple CPU cores are performing work for this process.\nThe result of a previous call to process.cpuUsage() can be passed as the\nargument to the function, to get a diff reading.\nconst startUsage = process.cpuUsage();\n// { user: 38579, system: 6986 }\n\n// spin the CPU for 500 milliseconds\nconst now = Date.now();\nwhile (Date.now() - now &lt; 500);\n\nconsole.log(process.cpuUsage(startUsage));\n// { user: 514883, system: 11226 }\n\nprocess.cwd()\n\nThe process.cwd() method returns the current working directory of the Node.js\nprocess.\nconsole.log(`Current directory: ${process.cwd()}`);\n\nprocess.disconnect()\n\nIf the Node.js process is spawned with an IPC channel (see the Child Process\nand Cluster documentation), the process.disconnect() method will close the\nIPC channel to the parent process, allowing the child process to exit gracefully\nonce there are no other connections keeping it alive.\nThe effect of calling process.disconnect() is that same as calling the parent\nprocess&#39;s ChildProcess.disconnect().\nIf the Node.js process was not spawned with an IPC channel,\nprocess.disconnect() will be undefined.\nprocess.env\n\nThe process.env property returns an object containing the user environment.\nSee environ(7).\nAn example of this object looks like:\n{\n  TERM: &#39;xterm-256color&#39;,\n  SHELL: &#39;/usr/local/bin/bash&#39;,\n  USER: &#39;maciej&#39;,\n  PATH: &#39;~/.bin/:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin&#39;,\n  PWD: &#39;/Users/maciej&#39;,\n  EDITOR: &#39;vim&#39;,\n  SHLVL: &#39;1&#39;,\n  HOME: &#39;/Users/maciej&#39;,\n  LOGNAME: &#39;maciej&#39;,\n  _: &#39;/usr/local/bin/node&#39;\n}\n\nIt is possible to modify this object, but such modifications will not be\nreflected outside the Node.js process. In other words, the following example\nwould not work:\n$ node -e &#39;process.env.foo = &quot;bar&quot;&#39; &amp;&amp; echo $foo\n\nWhile the following will:\nprocess.env.foo = &#39;bar&#39;;\nconsole.log(process.env.foo);\n\nAssigning a property on process.env will implicitly convert the value\nto a string.\nExample:\nprocess.env.test = null;\nconsole.log(process.env.test);\n// =&gt; &#39;null&#39;\nprocess.env.test = undefined;\nconsole.log(process.env.test);\n// =&gt; &#39;undefined&#39;\n\nUse delete to delete a property from process.env.\nExample:\nprocess.env.TEST = 1;\ndelete process.env.TEST;\nconsole.log(process.env.TEST);\n// =&gt; undefined\n\nprocess.emitWarning(warning[, name][, ctor])\n\n\nwarning {String | Error} The warning to emit.\nname {String} When warning is a String, name is the name to use\nfor the warning. Default: Warning.\nctor {Function} When warning is a String, ctor is an optional\nfunction used to limit the generated stack trace. Default\nprocess.emitWarning\n\nThe process.emitWarning() method can be used to emit custom or application\nspecific process warnings. These can be listened for by adding a handler to the\nprocess.on(&#39;warning&#39;) event.\n// Emit a warning using a string...\nprocess.emitWarning(&#39;Something happened!&#39;);\n  // Emits: (node: 56338) Warning: Something happened!\n\n// Emit a warning using a string and a name...\nprocess.emitWarning(&#39;Something Happened!&#39;, &#39;CustomWarning&#39;);\n  // Emits: (node:56338) CustomWarning: Something Happened!\n\nIn each of the previous examples, an Error object is generated internally by\nprocess.emitWarning() and passed through to the\nprocess.on(&#39;warning&#39;) event.\nprocess.on(&#39;warning&#39;, (warning) =&gt; {\n  console.warn(warning.name);\n  console.warn(warning.message);\n  console.warn(warning.stack);\n});\n\nIf warning is passed as an Error object, it will be passed through to the\nprocess.on(&#39;warning&#39;) event handler unmodified (and the optional name\nand ctor arguments will be ignored):\n// Emit a warning using an Error object...\nconst myWarning = new Error(&#39;Warning! Something happened!&#39;);\nmyWarning.name = &#39;CustomWarning&#39;;\n\nprocess.emitWarning(myWarning);\n  // Emits: (node:56338) CustomWarning: Warning! Something Happened!\n\nA TypeError is thrown if warning is anything other than a string or Error\nobject.\nNote that while process warnings use Error objects, the process warning\nmechanism is not a replacement for normal error handling mechanisms.\nThe following additional handling is implemented if the warning name is\nDeprecationWarning:\n\nIf the --throw-deprecation command-line flag is used, the deprecation\nwarning is thrown as an exception rather than being emitted as an event.\nIf the --no-deprecation command-line flag is used, the deprecation\nwarning is suppressed.\nIf the --trace-deprecation command-line flag is used, the deprecation\nwarning is printed to stderr along with the full stack trace.\n\nAvoiding duplicate warnings\nAs a best practice, warnings should be emitted only once per process. To do\nso, it is recommended to place the emitWarning() behind a simple boolean\nflag as illustrated in the example below:\nvar warned = false;\nfunction emitMyWarning() {\n  if (!warned) {\n    process.emitWarning(&#39;Only warn once!&#39;);\n    warned = true;\n  }\n}\nemitMyWarning();\n  // Emits: (node: 56339) Warning: Only warn once!\nemitMyWarning();\n  // Emits nothing\n\nprocess.execArgv\n\nThe process.execArgv property returns the set of Node.js-specific command-line\noptions passed when the Node.js process was launched. These options do not\nappear in the array returned by the process.argv property, and do not\ninclude the Node.js executable, the name of the script, or any options following\nthe script name. These options are useful in order to spawn child processes with\nthe same execution environment as the parent.\nFor example:\n$ node --harmony script.js --version\n\nResults in process.execArgv:\n[&#39;--harmony&#39;]\n\nAnd process.argv:\n[&#39;/usr/local/bin/node&#39;, &#39;script.js&#39;, &#39;--version&#39;]\n\nprocess.execPath\n\nThe process.execPath property returns the absolute pathname of the executable\nthat started the Node.js process.\nFor example:\n/usr/local/bin/node\n\nprocess.exit([code])\n\n\ncode {Integer} The exit code. Defaults to 0.\n\nThe process.exit() method instructs Node.js to terminate the process as\nquickly as possible with the specified exit code. If the code is omitted,\nexit uses either the &#39;success&#39; code 0 or the value of process.exitCode if\nspecified.\nTo exit with a &#39;failure&#39; code:\nprocess.exit(1);\n\nThe shell that executed Node.js should see the exit code as 1.\nIt is important to note that calling process.exit() will force the process to\nexit as quickly as possible even if there are still asynchronous operations\npending that have not yet completed fully, including I/O operations to\nprocess.stdout and process.stderr.\nIn most situations, it is not actually necessary to call process.exit()\nexplicitly. The Node.js process will exit on it&#39;s own if there is no additional\nwork pending in the event loop. The process.exitCode property can be set to\ntell the process which exit code to use when the process exits gracefully.\nFor instance, the following example illustrates a misuse of the\nprocess.exit() method that could lead to data printed to stdout being\ntruncated and lost:\n// This is an example of what *not* to do:\nif (someConditionNotMet()) {\n  printUsageToStdout();\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n\nThe reason this is problematic is because writes to process.stdout in Node.js\nare usually non-blocking and may occur over multiple ticks of the Node.js\nevent loop.\nCalling process.exit(), however, forces the process to exit before those\nadditional writes to stdout can be performed.\nRather than calling process.exit() directly, the code should set the\nprocess.exitCode and allow the process to exit naturally by avoiding\nscheduling any additional work for the event loop:\n// How to properly set the exit code while letting\n// the process exit gracefully.\nif (someConditionNotMet()) {\n  printUsageToStdout();\n  process.exitCode = 1;\n}\n\nIf it is necessary to terminate the Node.js process due to an error condition,\nthrowing an uncaught error and allowing the process to terminate accordingly\nis safer than calling process.exit().\nprocess.exitCode\n\nA number which will be the process exit code, when the process either\nexits gracefully, or is exited via process.exit() without specifying\na code.\nSpecifying a code to process.exit(code) will override any\nprevious setting of process.exitCode.\nprocess.getegid()\n\nThe process.getegid() method returns the numerical effective group identity\nof the Node.js process. (See getegid(2).)\nif (process.getegid) {\n  console.log(`Current gid: ${process.getegid()}`);\n}\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows\nor Android)\nprocess.geteuid()\n\nThe process.geteuid() method returns the numerical effective user identity of\nthe process. (See geteuid(2).)\nif (process.geteuid) {\n  console.log(`Current uid: ${process.geteuid()}`);\n}\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.getgid()\n\nThe process.getgid() method returns the numerical group identity of the\nprocess. (See getgid(2).)\nif (process.getgid) {\n  console.log(`Current gid: ${process.getgid()}`);\n}\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.getgroups()\n\nThe process.getgroups() method returns an array with the supplementary group\nIDs. POSIX leaves it unspecified if the effective group ID is included but\nNode.js ensures it always is.\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.getuid()\n\nThe process.getuid() method returns the numeric user identity of the process.\n(See getuid(2).)\nif (process.getuid) {\n  console.log(`Current uid: ${process.getuid()}`);\n}\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.hrtime([time])\n\nThe process.hrtime() method returns the current high-resolution real time in a\n[seconds, nanoseconds] tuple Array. time is an optional parameter that must\nbe the result of a previous process.hrtime() call (and therefore, a real time\nin a [seconds, nanoseconds] tuple Array containing a previous time) to diff\nwith the current time. These times are relative to an arbitrary time in the\npast, and not related to the time of day and therefore not subject to clock\ndrift. The primary use is for measuring performance between intervals.\nPassing in the result of a previous call to process.hrtime() is useful for\ncalculating an amount of time passed between calls:\nvar time = process.hrtime();\n// [ 1800216, 25 ]\n\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  var diff = process.hrtime(time);\n  // [ 1, 552 ]\n\n  console.log(`Benchmark took ${diff[0] * 1e9 + diff[1]} nanoseconds`);\n  // benchmark took 1000000527 nanoseconds\n}, 1000);\n\nConstructing an array by some method other than calling process.hrtime() and\npassing the result to process.hrtime() will result in undefined behavior.\nprocess.initgroups(user, extra_group)\n\n\nuser {String|number} The user name or numeric identifier.\nextra_group {String|number} A group name or numeric identifier.\n\nThe process.initgroups() method reads the /etc/group file and initializes\nthe group access list, using all groups of which the user is a member. This is\na privileged operation that requires that the Node.js process either have root\naccess or the CAP_SETGID capability.\nNote that care must be taken when dropping privileges. Example:\nconsole.log(process.getgroups());         // [ 0 ]\nprocess.initgroups(&#39;bnoordhuis&#39;, 1000);   // switch user\nconsole.log(process.getgroups());         // [ 27, 30, 46, 1000, 0 ]\nprocess.setgid(1000);                     // drop root gid\nconsole.log(process.getgroups());         // [ 27, 30, 46, 1000 ]\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.kill(pid[, signal])\n\n\npid {number} A process ID\nsignal {String|number} The signal to send, either as a string or number.\nDefaults to &#39;SIGTERM&#39;.\n\nThe process.kill() method sends the signal to the process identified by\npid.\nSignal names are strings such as &#39;SIGINT&#39; or &#39;SIGHUP&#39;. See Signal Events\nand kill(2) for more information.\nThis method will throw an error if the target pid does not exist. As a special\ncase, a signal of 0 can be used to test for the existence of a process.\nWindows platforms will throw an error if the pid is used to kill a process\ngroup.\nNote:Even though the name of this function is process.kill(), it is really\njust a signal sender, like the kill system call.  The signal sent may do\nsomething other than kill the target process.\nFor example:\nprocess.on(&#39;SIGHUP&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Got SIGHUP signal.&#39;);\n});\n\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Exiting.&#39;);\n  process.exit(0);\n}, 100);\n\nprocess.kill(process.pid, &#39;SIGHUP&#39;);\n\nNote: When SIGUSR1 is received by a Node.js process, Node.js will start the\ndebugger, see Signal Events.\nprocess.mainModule\n\nThe process.mainModule property provides an alternative way of retrieving\nrequire.main. The difference is that if the main module changes at\nruntime, require.main may still refer to the original main module in\nmodules that were required before the change occurred. Generally it&#39;s\nsafe to assume that the two refer to the same module.\nAs with require.main, process.mainModule will be undefined if there\nis no entry script.\nprocess.memoryUsage()\n\nThe process.memoryUsage() method returns an object describing the memory usage\nof the Node.js process measured in bytes.\nFor example, the code:\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nconsole.log(util.inspect(process.memoryUsage()));\n\nWill generate:\n{\n  rss: 4935680,\n  heapTotal: 1826816,\n  heapUsed: 650472\n}\n\nheapTotal and heapUsed refer to V8&#39;s memory usage.\nprocess.nextTick(callback[, arg][, ...])\n\n\ncallback {Function}\n[, arg][, ...] {any} Additional arguments to pass when invoking the\ncallback\n\nThe process.nextTick() method adds the callback to the &quot;next tick queue&quot;.\nOnce the current turn of the event loop turn runs to completion, all callbacks\ncurrently in the next tick queue will be called.\nThis is not a simple alias to setTimeout(fn, 0), it&#39;s much more\nefficient.  It runs before any additional I/O events (including\ntimers) fire in subsequent ticks of the event loop.\nconsole.log(&#39;start&#39;);\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;nextTick callback&#39;);\n});\nconsole.log(&#39;scheduled&#39;);\n// Output:\n// start\n// scheduled\n// nextTick callback\n\nThis is important when developing APIs in order to give users the opportunity\nto assign event handlers after an object has been constructed but before any\nI/O has occurred:\nfunction MyThing(options) {\n  this.setupOptions(options);\n\n  process.nextTick(() =&gt; {\n    this.startDoingStuff();\n  });\n}\n\nvar thing = new MyThing();\nthing.getReadyForStuff();\n\n// thing.startDoingStuff() gets called now, not before.\n\nIt is very important for APIs to be either 100% synchronous or 100%\nasynchronous.  Consider this example:\n// WARNING!  DO NOT USE!  BAD UNSAFE HAZARD!\nfunction maybeSync(arg, cb) {\n  if (arg) {\n    cb();\n    return;\n  }\n\n  fs.stat(&#39;file&#39;, cb);\n}\n\nThis API is hazardous because in the following case:\nmaybeSync(true, () =&gt; {\n  foo();\n});\nbar();\n\nIt is not clear whether foo() or bar() will be called first.\nThe following approach is much better:\nfunction definitelyAsync(arg, cb) {\n  if (arg) {\n    process.nextTick(cb);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  fs.stat(&#39;file&#39;, cb);\n}\n\nNote: the next tick queue is completely drained on each pass of the\nevent loop before additional I/O is processed.  As a result,\nrecursively setting nextTick callbacks will block any I/O from\nhappening, just like a while(true); loop.\nprocess.pid\n\nThe process.pid property returns the PID of the process.\nconsole.log(`This process is pid ${process.pid}`);\n\nprocess.platform\n\nThe process.platform property returns a string identifying the operating\nsystem platform on which the Node.js process is running. For instance\n&#39;darwin&#39;, &#39;freebsd&#39;, &#39;linux&#39;, &#39;sunos&#39; or &#39;win32&#39;\nconsole.log(`This platform is ${process.platform}`);\n\nprocess.release\n\nThe process.release property returns an Object containing metadata related to\nthe current release, including URLs for the source tarball and headers-only\ntarball.\nprocess.release contains the following properties:\n\nname {String} A value that will always be &#39;node&#39; for Node.js. For\nlegacy io.js releases, this will be &#39;io.js&#39;.\nsourceUrl {String} an absolute URL pointing to a _.tar.gz_ file containing\nthe source code of the current release.\nheadersUrl{String} an absolute URL pointing to a _.tar.gz_ file containing\nonly the source header files for the current release. This file is\nsignificantly smaller than the full source file and can be used for compiling\nNode.js native add-ons.\nlibUrl {String} an absolute URL pointing to a _node.lib_ file matching the\narchitecture and version of the current release. This file is used for\ncompiling Node.js native add-ons. This property is only present on Windows\nbuilds of Node.js and will be missing on all other platforms.\nlts {String} a string label identifying the [LTS][] label for this release.\nIf the Node.js release is not an LTS release, this will be undefined.\n\nFor example:\n{\n  name: &#39;node&#39;,\n  lts: &#39;Argon&#39;,\n  sourceUrl: &#39;https://nodejs.org/download/release/v4.4.5/node-v4.4.5.tar.gz&#39;,\n  headersUrl: &#39;https://nodejs.org/download/release/v4.4.5/node-v4.4.5-headers.tar.gz&#39;,\n  libUrl: &#39;https://nodejs.org/download/release/v4.4.5/win-x64/node.lib&#39;\n}\n\nIn custom builds from non-release versions of the source tree, only the\nname property may be present. The additional properties should not be\nrelied upon to exist.\nprocess.send(message[, sendHandle[, options]][, callback])\n\n\nmessage {Object}\nsendHandle {Handle object}\noptions {Object}\ncallback {Function}\nReturn: {Boolean}\n\nIf Node.js is spawned with an IPC channel, the process.send() method can be\nused to send messages to the parent process. Messages will be received as a\n&#39;message&#39; event on the parent&#39;s ChildProcess object.\nIf Node.js was not spawned with an IPC channel, process.send() will be\nundefined.\nNote: This function uses JSON.stringify() internally to serialize the\nmessage.*\nprocess.setegid(id)\n\n\nid {String|number} A group name or ID\n\nThe process.setegid() method sets the effective group identity of the process.\n(See setegid(2).) The id can be passed as either a numeric ID or a group\nname string. If a group name is specified, this method blocks while resolving\nthe associated a numeric ID.\nif (process.getegid &amp;&amp; process.setegid) {\n  console.log(`Current gid: ${process.getegid()}`);\n  try {\n    process.setegid(501);\n    console.log(`New gid: ${process.getegid()}`);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    console.log(`Failed to set gid: ${err}`);\n  }\n}\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.seteuid(id)\n\n\nid {String|number} A user name or ID\n\nThe process.seteuid() method sets the effective user identity of the process.\n(See seteuid(2).) The id can be passed as either a numeric ID or a username\nstring.  If a username is specified, the method blocks while resolving the\nassociated numeric ID.\nif (process.geteuid &amp;&amp; process.seteuid) {\n  console.log(`Current uid: ${process.geteuid()}`);\n  try {\n    process.seteuid(501);\n    console.log(`New uid: ${process.geteuid()}`);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    console.log(`Failed to set uid: ${err}`);\n  }\n}\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.setgid(id)\n\n\nid {String|number} The group name or ID\n\nThe process.setgid() method sets the group identity of the process. (See\nsetgid(2).)  The id can be passed as either a numeric ID or a group name\nstring. If a group name is specified, this method blocks while resolving the\nassociated numeric ID.\nif (process.getgid &amp;&amp; process.setgid) {\n  console.log(`Current gid: ${process.getgid()}`);\n  try {\n    process.setgid(501);\n    console.log(`New gid: ${process.getgid()}`);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    console.log(`Failed to set gid: ${err}`);\n  }\n}\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.setgroups(groups)\n\n\ngroups {Array}\n\nThe process.setgroups() method sets the supplementary group IDs for the\nNode.js proess. This is a privileged operation that requires the Node.js process\nto have root or the CAP_SETGID capability.\nThe groups array can contain numeric group IDs, group names or both.\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.setuid(id)\n\nThe process.setuid(id) method sets the user identity of the process. (See\nsetuid(2).)  Theid` can be passed as either a numeric ID or a username string.\nIf a username is specified, the method blocks while resolving the associated\nnumeric ID.\nif (process.getuid &amp;&amp; process.setuid) {\n  console.log(`Current uid: ${process.getuid()}`);\n  try {\n    process.setuid(501);\n    console.log(`New uid: ${process.getuid()}`);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    console.log(`Failed to set uid: ${err}`);\n  }\n}\n\nNote: This function is only available on POSIX platforms (i.e. not Windows or\nAndroid)\nprocess.stderr\nThe process.stderr property returns a Writable stream equivalent to or\nassociated with stderr (fd 2).\nprocess.stderr and process.stdout are unlike other streams in Node.js in\nthat they cannot be closed (calling end() will throw an Error), they never\nemit the &#39;finish&#39; event, and writes can block when output is redirected to\na file (although disks are fast and operating systems normally employ write-back\ncaching so it should be a very rare occurrence indeed.)\nAdditionally, process.stderr and process.stdout are blocking when outputting\nto TTYs (terminals) on OS X as a workaround for the OS&#39;s very small, 1kb\nbuffer size. This is to prevent interleaving between stdout and stderr.\nprocess.stdin\nThe process.stdin property returns a Readable stream equivalent to or\nassociated with stdin (fd 0).\nFor example:\nprocess.stdin.setEncoding(&#39;utf8&#39;);\n\nprocess.stdin.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  var chunk = process.stdin.read();\n  if (chunk !== null) {\n    process.stdout.write(`data: ${chunk}`);\n  }\n});\n\nprocess.stdin.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  process.stdout.write(&#39;end&#39;);\n});\n\nAs a Readable stream, process.stdin can also be used in &quot;old&quot; mode that\nis compatible with scripts written for Node.js prior to v0.10.\nFor more information see Stream compatibility.\nNote: In &quot;old&quot; streams mode the stdin stream is paused by default, so one\nmust call process.stdin.resume() to read from it. Note also that calling\nprocess.stdin.resume() itself would switch stream to &quot;old&quot; mode.\nprocess.stdout\nThe process.stdout propety returns a Writable stream equivalent to or\nassociated with stdout (fd 1).\nFor example:\nconsole.log = (msg) =&gt; {\n  process.stdout.write(`${msg}\\n`);\n};\n\nprocess.stderr and process.stdout are unlike other streams in Node.js in\nthat they cannot be closed (calling end() will throw an Error), they never\nemit the &#39;finish&#39; event and that writes can block when output is\nredirected to a file (although disks are fast and operating systems normally\nemploy write-back caching so it should be a very rare occurrence indeed.)\nTo check if Node.js is being run in a TTY context, read the isTTY property\non process.stderr, process.stdout, or process.stdin:\nTTY Terminals and process.stdout\nThe process.stderr and process.stdout streams are blocking when outputting\nto TTYs (terminals) on OS X as a workaround for the operating system&#39;s small,\n1kb buffer size. This is to prevent interleaving between stdout and stderr.\nTo check if Node.js is being run in a TTY context, check the isTTY\nproperty on process.stderr, process.stdout, or process.stdin.\nFor instance:\n$ node -p &quot;Boolean(process.stdin.isTTY)&quot;\ntrue\n$ echo &quot;foo&quot; | node -p &quot;Boolean(process.stdin.isTTY)&quot;\nfalse\n\n$ node -p &quot;Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)&quot;\ntrue\n$ node -p &quot;Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)&quot; | cat\nfalse\n\nSee the TTY documentation for more information.\nprocess.title\n\nThe process.title property returns the current process title (i.e. returns\nthe current value of ps). Assigning a new value to process.title modifies\nthe current value of ps.\nNote: When a new value is assigned, different platforms will impose different\nmaximum length restrictions on the title. Usually such restrictions are quite\nlimited. For instance, on Linux and OS X, process.title is limited to the size\nof the binary name plus the length of the command line arguments because setting\nthe process.title overwrites the argv memory of the process. Node.js v0.8\nallowed for longer process title strings by also overwriting the environ\nmemory but that was potentially insecure and confusing in some (rather obscure)\ncases.\nprocess.umask([mask])\n\n\nmask {number}\n\nThe process.umask() method sets or returns the Node.js process&#39;s file mode\ncreation mask. Child processes inherit the mask from the parent process. The old\nmask is return if the mask argument is given, otherwise returns the current\nmask.\nconst newmask = 0o022;\nconst oldmask = process.umask(newmask);\nconsole.log(\n  `Changed umask from ${oldmask.toString(8)} to ${newmask.toString(8)}`\n);\n\nprocess.uptime()\n\nThe process.uptime() method returns the number of seconds the current Node.js\nprocess has been running.\nprocess.version\n\nThe process.version property returns the Node.js version string.\nconsole.log(`Version: ${process.version}`);\n\nprocess.versions\n\nThe process.versions property returns an object listing the version strings of\nNode.js and its dependencies.\nconsole.log(process.versions);\n\nWill generate output similar to:\n{\n  http_parser: &#39;2.3.0&#39;,\n  node: &#39;1.1.1&#39;,\n  v8: &#39;4.1.0.14&#39;,\n  uv: &#39;1.3.0&#39;,\n  zlib: &#39;1.2.8&#39;,\n  ares: &#39;1.10.0-DEV&#39;,\n  modules: &#39;43&#39;,\n  icu: &#39;55.1&#39;,\n  openssl: &#39;1.0.1k&#39;\n}\n\nExit Codes\nNode.js will normally exit with a 0 status code when no more async\noperations are pending.  The following status codes are used in other\ncases:\n\n1 Uncaught Fatal Exception - There was an uncaught exception,\nand it was not handled by a domain or an &#39;uncaughtException&#39; event\nhandler.\n2 - Unused (reserved by Bash for builtin misuse)\n3 Internal JavaScript Parse Error - The JavaScript source code\ninternal in Node.js&#39;s bootstrapping process caused a parse error.  This\nis extremely rare, and generally can only happen during development\nof Node.js itself.\n4 Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure - The JavaScript\nsource code internal in Node.js&#39;s bootstrapping process failed to\nreturn a function value when evaluated.  This is extremely rare, and\ngenerally can only happen during development of Node.js itself.\n5 Fatal Error - There was a fatal unrecoverable error in V8.\nTypically a message will be printed to stderr with the prefix FATAL\nERROR.\n6 Non-function Internal Exception Handler - There was an\nuncaught exception, but the internal fatal exception handler\nfunction was somehow set to a non-function, and could not be called.\n7 Internal Exception Handler Run-Time Failure - There was an\nuncaught exception, and the internal fatal exception handler\nfunction itself threw an error while attempting to handle it.  This\ncan happen, for example, if a &#39;uncaughtException&#39; or\ndomain.on(&#39;error&#39;) handler throws an error.\n8 - Unused.  In previous versions of Node.js, exit code 8 sometimes\nindicated an uncaught exception.\n9 - Invalid Argument - Either an unknown option was specified,\nor an option requiring a value was provided without a value.\n10 Internal JavaScript Run-Time Failure - The JavaScript\nsource code internal in Node.js&#39;s bootstrapping process threw an error\nwhen the bootstrapping function was called.  This is extremely rare,\nand generally can only happen during development of Node.js itself.\n12 Invalid Debug Argument - The --debug, --inspect and/or\n--debug-brk options were set, but the port number chosen was invalid\nor unavailable.\n&gt;128 Signal Exits - If Node.js receives a fatal signal such as\nSIGKILL or SIGHUP, then its exit code will be 128 plus the\nvalue of the signal code.  This is a standard Unix practice, since\nexit codes are defined to be 7-bit integers, and signal exits set\nthe high-order bit, and then contain the value of the signal code.\n\n"},"punycode.html":{"url":"punycode.html","title":"Punycode","body":"title: punycode\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\npunycode\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe punycode module is a bundled version of the Punycode.js module.

Because host\nnames in URLs are limited to ASCII characters only, Domain Names that contain\nnon-ASCII characters must be converted into ASCII using the Punycode scheme.\nFor instance, the Japanese character that translates into the English word,\n&#39;example&#39; is &#39;例&#39;. The Internationalized Domain Name, &#39;例.com&#39; (equivalent\nto &#39;example.com&#39;) is represented by Punycode as the ASCII string\n&#39;xn--fsq.com&#39;.\nThe punycode module provides a simple implementation of the Punycode standard.\nNote: The punycode module is a third-party dependency used by Node.js and\nmade available to developers as a convenience.

If an alternative encoding is required, then an alternative\nencodeURIComponent option will need to be specified as illustrated in the\nfollowing example:\n// Assuming gbkEncodeURIComponent function already exists,\n\nquerystring.stringify({ w: &#39;中文&#39;, foo: &#39;bar&#39; }, null, null,\n  { encodeURIComponent: gbkEncodeURIComponent })\n\nquerystring.unescape(str)\n\n\nstr {String}\n\nThe querystring.unescape() method performs decoding of URL percent-encoded\ncharacters on the given str.\nThe querystring.unescape() method is used by querystring.parse() and is\ngenerally not expected to be used directly. It is exported primarily to allow\napplication code to provide a replacement decoding implementation if\nnecessary by assigning querystring.unescape to an alternative function.\nBy default, the querystring.unescape() method will attempt to use the\nJavaScript built-in decodeURIComponent() method to decode. If that fails,\na safer equivalent that does not throw on malformed URLs will be used.\n"},"readline.html":{"url":"readline.html","title":"Readline","body":"title: readline\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nReadline\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe readline module provides an interface for reading data from a Readable\nstream (such as process.stdin) one line at a time. It can be accessed using:\nconst readline = require(&#39;readline&#39;);\n\nThe following simple example illustrates the basic use of the readline module.\nconst readline = require(&#39;readline&#39;);\n\nconst rl = readline.createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout\n});\n\nrl.question(&#39;What do you think of Node.js? &#39;, (answer) =&gt; {\n  // TODO: Log the answer in a database\n  console.log(&#39;Thank you for your valuable feedback:&#39;, answer);\n\n  rl.close();\n});\n\nNote Once this code is invoked, the Node.js application will not\nterminate until the readline.Interface is closed because the interface\nwaits for data to be received on the input stream.\nClass: Interface\n\nInstances of the readline.Interface class are constructed using the\nreadline.createInterface() method. Every instance is associated with a\nsingle input Readable stream and a single output Writable stream.\nThe output stream is used to print prompts for user input that arrives on,\nand is read from, the input stream.\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nThe &#39;close&#39; event is emitted when one of the following occur:\n\nThe rl.close() method is called and the readline.Interface instance has\nrelinquished control over the input and output streams;\nThe input stream receives its &#39;end&#39; event;\nThe input stream receives &lt;ctrl&gt;-D to signal end-of-transmission (EOT);\nThe input stream receives &lt;ctrl&gt;-C to signal SIGINT and there is no\nSIGINT event listener registered on the readline.Interface instance.\n\nThe listener function is called without passing any arguments.\nThe readline.Interface instance should be considered to be &quot;finished&quot; once\nthe &#39;close&#39; event is emitted.\nEvent: &#39;line&#39;\n\nThe &#39;line&#39; event is emitted whenever the input stream receives an\nend-of-line input (\\n, \\r, or \\r\\n). This usually occurs when the user\npresses the &lt;Enter&gt;, or &lt;Return&gt; keys.\nThe listener function is called with a string containing the single line of\nreceived input.\nFor example:\nrl.on(&#39;line&#39;, (input) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Received: ${input}`);\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;pause&#39;\n\nThe &#39;pause&#39; event is emitted when one of the following occur:\n\nThe input stream is paused.\nThe input stream is not paused and receives the SIGCONT event. (See\nevents SIGTSTP and SIGCONT)\n\nThe listener function is called without passing any arguments.\nFor example:\nrl.on(&#39;pause&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Readline paused.&#39;);\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;resume&#39;\n\nThe &#39;resume&#39; event is emitted whenever the input stream is resumed.\nThe listener function is called without passing any arguments.\nrl.on(&#39;resume&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Readline resumed.&#39;);\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;SIGCONT&#39;\n\nThe &#39;SIGCONT&#39; event is emitted when a Node.js process previously moved into\nthe background using &lt;ctrl&gt;-Z (i.e. SIGTSTP) is then brought back to the\nforeground using fg(1).\nIf the input stream was paused before the SIGSTP request, this event will\nnot be emitted.\nThe listener function is invoked without passing any arguments.\nFor example:\nrl.on(&#39;SIGCONT&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  // `prompt` will automatically resume the stream\n  rl.prompt();\n});\n\nNote: The &#39;SIGCONT&#39; event is not supported on Windows.\nEvent: &#39;SIGINT&#39;\n\nThe &#39;SIGINT&#39; event is emitted whenever the input stream receives a\n&lt;ctrl&gt;-C input, known typically as SIGINT. If there are no &#39;SIGINT&#39; event\nlisteners registered when the input stream receives a SIGINT, the &#39;pause&#39;\nevent will be emitted.\nThe listener function is invoked without passing any arguments.\nFor example:\nrl.on(&#39;SIGINT&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  rl.question(&#39;Are you sure you want to exit?&#39;, (answer) =&gt; {\n    if (answer.match(/^y(es)?$/i)) rl.pause();\n  });\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;SIGTSTP&#39;\n\nThe &#39;SIGTSPT&#39; event is emitted when the input stream receives a &lt;ctrl&gt;-Z\ninput, typically known as SIGTSTP. If there are no SIGTSTP event listeners\nregistered when the input stream receives a SIGTSTP, the Node.js process\nwill be sent to the background.\nWhen the program is resumed using fg(1), the &#39;pause&#39; and SIGCONT events\nwill be emitted. These can be used to resume the input stream.\nThe &#39;pause&#39; and &#39;SIGCONT&#39; events will not be emitted if the input was\npaused before the process was sent to the background.\nThe listener function is invoked without passing any arguments.\nFor example:\nrl.on(&#39;SIGTSTP&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  // This will override SIGTSTP and prevent the program from going to the\n  // background.\n  console.log(&#39;Caught SIGTSTP.&#39;);\n});\n\nNote: The &#39;SIGTSTP&#39; event is not supported on Windows.\nrl.close()\n\nThe rl.close() method closes the readline.Interface instance and\nrelinquishes control over the input and output streams. When called,\nthe &#39;close&#39; event will be emitted.\nCloses the Interface instance, relinquishing control on the input and\noutput streams. The &#39;close&#39; event will also be emitted.\nrl.pause()\n\nThe rl.pause() method pauses the input stream, allowing it to be resumed\nlater if necessary.\nCalling rl.pause() does not immediately pause other events (including\n&#39;line&#39;) from being emitted by the readline.Interface instance.\nrl.prompt([preserveCursor])\n\n\npreserveCursor {boolean} If true, prevents the cursor placement from\nbeing reset to 0.\n\nThe rl.prompt() method writes the readline.Interface instances configured\nprompt to a new line in output in order to provide a user with a new\nlocation at which to provide input.\nWhen called, rl.prompt() will resume the input stream if it has been\npaused.\nIf the readline.Interface was created with output set to null or\nundefined the prompt is not written.\nrl.question(query, callback)\n\n\nquery {String} A statement or query to write to output, prepended to the\nprompt.\ncallback {Function} A callback function that is invoked with the user&#39;s\ninput in response to the query.\n\nThe rl.question() method displays the query by writing it to the output,\nwaits for user input to be provided on input, then invokes the callback\nfunction passing the provided input as the first argument.\nWhen called, rl.question() will resume the input stream if it has been\npaused.\nIf the readline.Interface was created with output set to null or\nundefined the query is not written.\nExample usage:\nrl.question(&#39;What is your favorite food?&#39;, (answer) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Oh, so your favorite food is ${answer}`);\n});\n\nNote: The callback function passed to rl.question() does not follow the\ntypical pattern of accepting an Error object or null as the first argument.\nThe callback is called with the provided answer as the only argument.\nrl.resume()\n\nThe rl.resume() method resumes the input stream if it has been paused.\nrl.setPrompt(prompt)\n\n\nprompt {String}\n\nThe rl.setPrompt() method sets the prompt that will be written to output\nwhenever rl.prompt() is called.\nrl.write(data[, key])\n\n\ndata {String}\nkey {Object}\nctrl {boolean} true to indicate the &lt;ctrl&gt; key.\nmeta {boolean} true to indicate the &lt;Meta&gt; key.\nshift {boolean} true to indicate the &lt;Shift&gt; key.\nname {String} The name of the a key.\n\n\n\nThe rl.write() method will write either data or a key sequence  identified\nby key to the output. The key argument is supported only if output is\na TTY text terminal.\nIf key is specified, data is ignored.\nWhen called, rl.write() will resume the input stream if it has been\npaused.\nIf the readline.Interface was created with output set to null or\nundefined the data and key are not written.\nFor example:\nrl.write(&#39;Delete this!&#39;);\n// Simulate Ctrl+u to delete the line written previously\nrl.write(null, {ctrl: true, name: &#39;u&#39;});\n\nreadline.clearLine(stream, dir)\n\n\nstream {Writable}\ndir {number}\n-1 - to the left from cursor\n1 - to the right from cursor\n0 - the entire line\n\n\n\nThe readline.clearLine() method clears current line of given TTY stream\nin a specified direction identified by dir.\nreadline.clearScreenDown(stream)\n\n\nstream {Writable}\n\nThe readline.clearScreenDown() method clears the given TTY stream from\nthe current position of the cursor down.\nreadline.createInterface(options)\n\n\noptions {Object}\ninput {Readable} The Readable stream to listen to. This option is\nrequired.\noutput {Writable} The Writable stream to write readline data to.\ncompleter {Function} An optional function used for Tab autocompletion.\nterminal {boolean} true if the input and output streams should be\ntreated like a TTY, and have ANSI/VT100 escape codes written to it.\nDefaults to checking isTTY on the output stream upon instantiation.\nhistorySize {number} maximum number of history lines retained. To disable\nthe history set this value to 0. Defaults to 30. This option makes sense\nonly if terminal is set to true by the user or by an internal output\ncheck, otherwise the history caching mechanism is not initialized at all.\nprompt - the prompt string to use. Default: &#39;&gt; &#39;\n\n\n\nThe readline.createInterface() method creates a new readline.Interface\ninstance.\nFor example:\nconst readline = require(&#39;readline&#39;);\nconst rl = readline.createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout\n});\n\nOnce the readline.Interface instance is created, the most common case is to\nlisten for the &#39;line&#39; event:\nrl.on(&#39;line&#39;, (line) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Received: ${line}`);\n});\n\nIf terminal is true for this instance then the output stream will get\nthe best compatibility if it defines an output.columns property and emits\na &#39;resize&#39; event on the output if or when the columns ever change\n(process.stdout does this automatically when it is a TTY).\nUse of the completer Function\nWhen called, the completer function is provided the current line entered by\nthe user, and is expected to return an Array with 2 entries:\n\nAn Array with matching entries for the completion.\nThe substring that was used for the matching.\n\nFor instance: [[substr1, substr2, ...], originalsubstring].\nfunction completer(line) {\n  var completions = &#39;.help .error .exit .quit .q&#39;.split(&#39; &#39;);\n  var hits = completions.filter((c) =&gt; { return c.indexOf(line) == 0 });\n  // show all completions if none found\n  return [hits.length ? hits : completions, line];\n}\n\nThe completer function can be called asynchronously if it accepts two\narguments:\nfunction completer(linePartial, callback) {\n  callback(null, [[&#39;123&#39;], linePartial]);\n}\n\nreadline.cursorTo(stream, x, y)\n\n\nstream {Writable}\nx {number}\ny {number}\n\nThe readline.cursorTo() method moves cursor to the specified position in a\ngiven TTY stream.\nreadline.emitKeypressEvents(stream[, interface])\n\n\nstream {Readable}\ninterface {readline.Interface}\n\nThe readline.emitKeypressEvents() method causes the given Writable\nstream to begin emitting &#39;keypress&#39; events corresponding to received input.\nOptionally, interface specifies a readline.Interface instance for which\nautocompletion is disabled when copy-pasted input is detected.\nIf the stream is a TTY, then it must be in raw mode.\nreadline.emitKeypressEvents(process.stdin);\nif (process.stdin.isTTY)\n  process.stdin.setRawMode(true);\n\nreadline.moveCursor(stream, dx, dy)\n\n\nstream {Writable}\ndx {number}\ndy {Number}\n\nThe readline.moveCursor() method moves the cursor relative to its current\nposition in a given TTY stream.\nExample: Tiny CLI\nThe following example illustrates the use of readline.Interface class to\nimplement a small command-line interface:\nconst readline = require(&#39;readline&#39;);\nconst rl = readline.createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout,\n  prompt: &#39;OHAI&gt; &#39;\n});\n\nrl.prompt();\n\nrl.on(&#39;line&#39;, (line) =&gt; {\n  switch(line.trim()) {\n    case &#39;hello&#39;:\n      console.log(&#39;world!&#39;);\n      break;\n    default:\n      console.log(`Say what? I might have heard &#39;${line.trim()}&#39;`);\n      break;\n  }\n  rl.prompt();\n}).on(&#39;close&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Have a great day!&#39;);\n  process.exit(0);\n});\n\nExample: Read File Stream Line-by-Line\nA common use case for readline is to consume input from a filesystem\nReadable stream one line at a time, as illustrated in the following\nexample:\nconst readline = require(&#39;readline&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n\nconst rl = readline.createInterface({\n  input: fs.createReadStream(&#39;sample.txt&#39;)\n});\n\nrl.on(&#39;line&#39;, (line) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Line from file:&#39;, line);\n});\n\n"},"repl.html":{"url":"repl.html","title":"REPL","body":"title: repl\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nREPL\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe repl module provides a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) implementation that\nis available both as a standalone program or includable in other applications.\nIt can be accessed using:\nconst repl = require(&#39;repl&#39;);\n\nDesign and Features\nThe repl module exports the repl.REPLServer class. While running, instances\nof repl.REPLServer will accept individual lines of user input, evaluate those\naccording to a user-defined evaluation function, then output the result. Input\nand output may be from stdin and stdout, respectively, or may be connected\nto any Node.js stream.\nInstances of repl.REPLServer support automatic completion of inputs,\nsimplistic Emacs-style line editing, multi-line inputs, ANSI-styled output,\nsaving and restoring current REPL session state, error recovery, and\ncustomizable evaluation functions.\nCommands and Special Keys\nThe following special commands are supported by all REPL instances:\n\n.break - When in the process of inputting a multi-line expression, entering\nthe .break command (or pressing the &lt;ctrl&gt;-C key combination) will abort\nfurther input or processing of that expression.\n.clear - Resets the REPL context to an empty object and clears any\nmulti-line expression currently being input.\n.exit - Close the I/O stream, causing the REPL to exit.\n.help - Show this list of special commands.\n.save - Save the current REPL session to a file:\n&gt; .save ./file/to/save.js\n.load - Load a file into the current REPL session.\n&gt; .load ./file/to/load.js\n\nThe following key combinations in the REPL have these special effects:\n\n&lt;ctrl&gt;-C - When pressed once, has the same effect as the .break command.\nWhen pressed twice on a blank line, has the same effect as the .exit\ncommand.\n&lt;ctrl&gt;-D - Has the same effect as the .exit command.\n&lt;tab&gt; - When pressed on a blank line, displays global and local(scope)\nvariables. When pressed while entering other input, displays relevant\nautocompletion options.\n\nDefault Evaluation\nBy default, all instances of repl.REPLServer use an evaluation function that\nevaluates JavaScript expressions and provides access to Node.js&#39; built-in\nmodules. This default behavior can be overridden by passing in an alternative\nevaluation function when the repl.REPLServer instance is created.\nJavaScript Expressions\nThe default evaluator supports direct evaluation of JavaScript expressions:\n&gt; 1 + 1\n2\n&gt; var m = 2\nundefined\n&gt; m + 1\n3\n\nUnless otherwise scoped within blocks (e.g. { ... }) or functions, variables\ndeclared either implicitly or using the var keyword are declared at the\nglobal scope.\nGlobal and Local Scope\nThe default evaluator provides access to any variables that exist in the global\nscope. It is possible to expose a variable to the REPL explicitly by assigning\nit to the context object associated with each REPLServer.  For example:\nconst repl = require(&#39;repl&#39;);\nvar msg = &#39;message&#39;;\n\nrepl.start(&#39;&gt; &#39;).context.m = msg;\n\nProperties in the context object appear as local within the REPL:\n$ node repl_test.js\n&gt; m\n&#39;message&#39;\n\nIt is important to note that context properties are not read-only by default.\nTo specify read-only globals, context properties must be defined using\nObject.defineProperty():\nconst repl = require(&#39;repl&#39;);\nvar msg = &#39;message&#39;;\n\nconst r = repl.start(&#39;&gt; &#39;);\nObject.defineProperty(r, &#39;m&#39;, {\n  configurable: false,\n  enumerable: true,\n  value: msg\n});\n\nAccessing Core Node.js Modules\nThe default evaluator will automatically load Node.js core modules into the\nREPL environment when used. For instance, unless otherwise declared as a\nglobal or scoped variable, the input fs will be evaluated on-demand as\nglobal.fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;).\n&gt; fs.createReadStream(&#39;./some/file&#39;);\n\nAssignment of the _ (underscore) variable\nThe default evaluator will, by default, assign the result of the most recently\nevaluated expression to the special variable _ (underscore).\n&gt; [ &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39; ]\n[ &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39; ]\n&gt; _.length\n3\n&gt; _ += 1\n4\n\nExplicitly setting _ to a value will disable this behavior.\nCustom Evaluation Functions\nWhen a new repl.REPLServer is created, a custom evaluation function may be\nprovided. This can be used, for instance, to implement fully customized REPL\napplications.\nThe following illustrates a hypothetical example of a REPL that performs\ntranslation of text from one language to another:\nconst repl = require(&#39;repl&#39;);\nconst Translator = require(&#39;translator&#39;).Translator;\n\nconst myTranslator = new Translator(&#39;en&#39;, &#39;fr&#39;);\n\nfunction myEval(cmd, context, filename, callback) {\n  callback(null, myTranslator.translate(cmd));\n}\n\nrepl.start({prompt: &#39;&gt; &#39;, eval: myEval});\n\nRecoverable Errors\nAs a user is typing input into the REPL prompt, pressing the &lt;enter&gt; key will\nsend the current line of input to the eval function. In order to support\nmulti-line input, the eval function can return an instance of repl.Recoverable\nto the provided callback function:\nfunction eval(cmd, context, filename, callback) {\n  var result;\n  try {\n    result = vm.runInThisContext(cmd);\n  } catch (e) {\n    if (isRecoverableError(e)) {\n      return callback(new repl.Recoverable(e));\n    }\n  }\n  callback(null, result);\n}\n\nfunction isRecoverableError(error) {\n  if (error.name === &#39;SyntaxError&#39;) {\n    return /^(Unexpected end of input|Unexpected token)/.test(error.message);\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n\nCustomizing REPL Output\nBy default, repl.REPLServer instances format output using the\nutil.inspect() method before writing the output to the provided Writable\nstream (process.stdout by default). The useColors boolean option can be\nspecified at construction to instruct the default writer to use ANSI style\ncodes to colorize the output from the util.inspect() method.\nIt is possible to fully customize the output of a repl.REPLServer instance\nby passing a new function in using the writer option on construction. The\nfollowing example, for instance, simply converts any input text to upper case:\nconst repl = require(&#39;repl&#39;);\n\nconst r = repl.start({prompt: &#39;&gt;&#39;, eval: myEval, writer: myWriter});\n\nfunction myEval(cmd, context, filename, callback) {\n  callback(null,cmd);\n}\n\nfunction myWriter(output) {\n  return output.toUpperCase();\n}\n\nClass: REPLServer\n\nThe repl.REPLServer class inherits from the readline.Interface class.\nInstances of repl.REPLServer are created using the repl.start() method and\nshould not be created directly using the JavaScript new keyword.\nEvent: &#39;exit&#39;\n\nThe &#39;exit&#39; event is emitted when the REPL is exited either by receiving the\n.exit command as input, the user pressing &lt;ctrl&gt;-C twice to signal SIGINT,\nor by pressing &lt;ctrl&gt;-D to signal &#39;end&#39; on the input stream. The listener\ncallback is invoked without any arguments.\nreplServer.on(&#39;exit&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Received &quot;exit&quot; event from repl!&#39;);\n  process.exit();\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;reset&#39;\n\nThe &#39;reset&#39; event is emitted when the REPL&#39;s context is reset. This occurs\nwhenever the .clear command is received as input unless the REPL is using\nthe default evaluator and the repl.REPLServer instance was created with the\nuseGlobal option set to true. The listener callback will be called with a\nreference to the context object as the only argument.\nThis can be used primarily to re-initialize REPL context to some pre-defined\nstate as illustrated in the following simple example:\nconst repl = require(&#39;repl&#39;);\n\nfunction initializeContext(context) {\n  context.m = &#39;test&#39;;\n}\n\nvar r = repl.start({prompt: &#39;&gt;&#39;});\ninitializeContext(r.context);\n\nr.on(&#39;reset&#39;, initializeContext);\n\nWhen this code is executed, the global &#39;m&#39; variable can be modified but then\nreset to its initial value using the .clear command:\n$ ./node example.js\n&gt;m\n&#39;test&#39;\n&gt;m = 1\n1\n&gt;m\n1\n&gt;.clear\nClearing context...\n&gt;m\n&#39;test&#39;\n&gt;\n\nreplServer.defineCommand(keyword, cmd)\n\n\nkeyword {String} The command keyword (without a leading . character).\ncmd {Object|Function} The function to invoke when the command is processed.\n\nThe replServer.defineCommand() method is used to add new .-prefixed commands\nto the REPL instance. Such commands are invoked by typing a . followed by the\nkeyword. The cmd is either a Function or an object with the following\nproperties:\n\nhelp {String} Help text to be displayed when .help is entered (Optional).\naction {Function} The function to execute, optionally accepting a single\nstring argument.\n\nThe following example shows two new commands added to the REPL instance:\nconst repl = require(&#39;repl&#39;);\n\nvar replServer = repl.start({prompt: &#39;&gt; &#39;});\nreplServer.defineCommand(&#39;sayhello&#39;, {\n  help: &#39;Say hello&#39;,\n  action: function(name) {\n    this.lineParser.reset();\n    this.bufferedCommand = &#39;&#39;;\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n    this.displayPrompt();\n  }\n});\nreplServer.defineCommand(&#39;saybye&#39;, function() {\n  console.log(&#39;Goodbye!&#39;);\n  this.close();\n});\n\nThe new commands can then be used from within the REPL instance:\n&gt; .sayhello Node.js User\nHello, Node.js User!\n&gt; .saybye\nGoodbye!\n\nreplServer.displayPrompt([preserveCursor])\n\n\npreserveCursor {Boolean}\n\nThe replServer.displayPrompt() method readies the REPL instance for input\nfrom the user, printing the configured prompt to a new line in the output\nand resuming the input to accept new input.\nWhen multi-line input is being entered, an ellipsis is printed rather than the\n&#39;prompt&#39;.\nWhen preserveCursor is true, the cursor placement will not be reset to 0.\nThe replServer.displayPrompt method is primarily intended to be called from\nwithin the action function for commands registered using the\nreplServer.defineCommand() method.\nrepl.start([options])\n\n\noptions {Object}\nprompt {String} The input prompt to display. Defaults to &gt;.\ninput {Readable} The Readable stream from which REPL input will be read.\nDefaults to process.stdin.\noutput {Writable} The Writable stream to which REPL output will be\nwritten. Defaults to process.stdout.\nterminal {boolean} If true, specifies that the output should be\ntreated as a a TTY terminal, and have ANSI/VT100 escape codes written to it.\nDefaults to checking the value of the isTTY property on the output\nstream upon instantiation.\neval {Function} The function to be used when evaluating each given line\nof input. Defaults to an async wrapper for the JavaScript eval()\nfunction.  An eval function can error with repl.Recoverable to indicate\nthe input was incomplete and prompt for additional lines.\nuseColors {boolean} If true, specifies that the default writer\nfunction should include ANSI color styling to REPL output. If a custom\nwriter function is provided then this has no effect. Defaults to the\n REPL instances terminal value.\nuseGlobal {boolean} If true, specifies that the default evaluation\n function will use the JavaScript global as the context as opposed to\n creating a new separate context for the REPL instance. Defaults to false.\nignoreUndefined {boolean} If true, specifies that the default writer\n will not output the return value of a command if it evaluates to\n undefined. Defaults to false.\nwriter {Function} The function to invoke to format the output of each\n command before writing to output. Defaults to util.inspect().\ncompleter {Function} An optional function used for custom Tab auto\n completion. See readline.InterfaceCompleter for an example.\nreplMode - A flag that specifies whether the default evaluator executes\nall JavaScript commands in strict mode, default mode, or a hybrid mode\n(&quot;magic&quot; mode.) Acceptable values are:\nrepl.REPL_MODE_SLOPPY - evaluates expressions in sloppy mode.\nrepl.REPL_MODE_STRICT - evaluates expressions in strict mode. This is\nequivalent to prefacing every repl statement with &#39;use strict&#39;.\nrepl.REPL_MODE_MAGIC - attempt to evaluates expressions in default\nmode.  If expressions fail to parse, re-try in strict mode.\n\n\nbreakEvalOnSigint - Stop evaluating the current piece of code when\nSIGINT is received, i.e. Ctrl+C is pressed. This cannot be used together\nwith a custom eval function. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\nThe repl.start() method creates and starts a repl.REPLServer instance.\nThe Node.js REPL\nNode.js itself uses the repl module to provide its own interactive interface\nfor executing JavaScript. This can used by executing the Node.js binary without\npassing any arguments (or by passing the -i argument):\n$ node\n&gt; a = [1, 2, 3];\n[ 1, 2, 3 ]\n&gt; a.forEach((v) =&gt; {\n...   console.log(v);\n...   });\n1\n2\n3\n\nEnvironment Variable Options\nVarious behaviors of the Node.js REPL can be customized using the following\nenvironment variables:\n\nNODE_REPL_HISTORY - When a valid path is given, persistent REPL history\nwill be saved to the specified file rather than .node_repl_history in the\nuser&#39;s home directory. Setting this value to &quot;&quot; will disable persistent\nREPL history. Whitespace will be trimmed from the value.\nNODE_REPL_HISTORY_SIZE - Defaults to 1000. Controls how many lines of\nhistory will be persisted if history is available. Must be a positive number.\nNODE_REPL_MODE - May be any of sloppy, strict, or magic. Defaults\nto magic, which will automatically run &quot;strict mode only&quot; statements in\nstrict mode.\n\nPersistent History\nBy default, the Node.js REPL will persist history between node REPL sessions\nby saving inputs to a .node_repl_history file located in the user&#39;s home\ndirectory. This can be disabled by setting the environment variable\nNODE_REPL_HISTORY=&quot;&quot;.\nNODE_REPL_HISTORY_FILE\n\n   Stability: 0 - Deprecated: Use NODE_REPL_HISTORY instead.\nPreviously in Node.js/io.js v2.x, REPL history was controlled by using a\nNODE_REPL_HISTORY_FILE environment variable, and the history was saved in JSON\nformat. This variable has now been deprecated, and the old JSON REPL history\nfile will be automatically converted to a simplified plain text format. This new\nfile will be saved to either the user&#39;s home directory, or a directory defined\nby the NODE_REPL_HISTORY variable, as documented in the\nEnvironment Variable Options.\nUsing the Node.js REPL with advanced line-editors\nFor advanced line-editors, start Node.js with the environmental variable\nNODE_NO_READLINE=1. This will start the main and debugger REPL in canonical\nterminal settings which will allow you to use with rlwrap.\nFor example, you could add this to your bashrc file:\nalias node=&quot;env NODE_NO_READLINE=1 rlwrap node&quot;\n\nStarting multiple REPL instances against a single running instance\nIt is possible to create and run multiple REPL instances against a single\nrunning instance of Node.js that share a single global object but have\nseparate I/O interfaces.\nThe following example, for instance, provides separate REPLs on stdin, a Unix\nsocket, and a TCP socket:\nconst net = require(&#39;net&#39;);\nconst repl = require(&#39;repl&#39;);\nvar connections = 0;\n\nrepl.start({\n  prompt: &#39;Node.js via stdin&gt; &#39;,\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout\n});\n\nnet.createServer((socket) =&gt; {\n  connections += 1;\n  repl.start({\n    prompt: &#39;Node.js via Unix socket&gt; &#39;,\n    input: socket,\n    output: socket\n  }).on(&#39;exit&#39;, () =&gt; {\n    socket.end();\n  });\n}).listen(&#39;/tmp/node-repl-sock&#39;);\n\nnet.createServer((socket) =&gt; {\n  connections += 1;\n  repl.start({\n    prompt: &#39;Node.js via TCP socket&gt; &#39;,\n    input: socket,\n    output: socket\n  }).on(&#39;exit&#39;, () =&gt; {\n    socket.end();\n  });\n}).listen(5001);\n\nRunning this application from the command line will start a REPL on stdin.\nOther REPL clients may connect through the Unix socket or TCP socket. telnet,\nfor instance, is useful for connecting to TCP sockets, while socat can be used\nto connect to both Unix and TCP sockets.\nBy starting a REPL from a Unix socket-based server instead of stdin, it is\npossible to connect to a long-running Node.js process without restarting it.\nFor an example of running a &quot;full-featured&quot; (terminal) REPL over\na net.Server and net.Socket instance, see: https://gist.github.com/2209310\nFor an example of running a REPL instance over curl(1),\nsee: https://gist.github.com/2053342\n"},"stream.html":{"url":"stream.html","title":"Stream","body":"title: stream\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nStream\nStability: 2 - Stable\nA stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.\nThe stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects\nthat implement the stream interface.\nThere are many stream objects provided by Node.js. For instance, a\nrequest to an HTTP server and process.stdout\nare both stream instances.\nStreams can be readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of\nEventEmitter.\nThe stream module can be accessed using:\nconst stream = require(&#39;stream&#39;);\n\nWhile it is important for all Node.js users to understand how streams works,\nthe stream module itself is most useful for developers that are creating new\ntypes of stream instances. Developer&#39;s who are primarily consuming stream\nobjects will rarely (if ever) have need to use the stream module directly.\nOrganization of this document\nThis document is divided into two primary sections and third section for\nadditional notes. The first section explains the elements of the stream API that\nare required to use streams within an application. The second section explains\nthe elements of the API that are required to implement new types of streams.\nTypes of Streams\nThere are four fundamental stream types within Node.js:\n\nReadable - streams from which data can be read (for example\nfs.createReadStream()).\nWritable - streams to which data can be written (for example\nfs.createWriteStream()).\nDuplex - streams that are both Readable and Writable (for example\nnet.Socket).\nTransform - Duplex streams that can modify or transform the data as it\nis written and read (for example zlib.createDeflate()).\n\nObject Mode\nAll streams created by Node.js APIs operate exclusively on strings and Buffer\nobjects. It is possible, however, for stream implementations to work with other\ntypes of JavaScript values (with the exception of null which serves a special\npurpose within streams). Such streams are considered to operate in &quot;object\nmode&quot;.\nStream instances are switched into object mode using the objectMode option\nwhen the stream is created. Attempting to switch an existing stream into\nobject mode is not safe.\nBuffering\n\nBoth Writable and Readable streams will store data in an internal\nbuffer that can be retrieved using writable._writableState.getBuffer() or\nreadable._readableState.buffer, respectively.\nThe amount of data potentially buffered depends on the highWaterMark option\npassed into the streams constructor. For normal streams, the highWaterMark\noption specifies a total number of bytes. For streams operating in object mode,\nthe highWaterMark specifies a total number of objects.\nData is buffered in Readable streams when the implementation calls\nstream.push(chunk). If the consumer of the Stream does not\ncall stream.read(), the data will sit in the internal\nqueue until it is consumed.\nOnce the total size of the internal read buffer reaches the threshold specified\nby highWaterMark, the stream will temporarily stop reading data from the\nunderlying resource until the data currently buffered can be consumed (that is,\nthe stream will stop calling the internal readable._read() method that is\nused to fill the read buffer).\nData is buffered in Writable streams when the\nwritable.write(chunk) method is called repeatedly. While the\ntotal size of the internal write buffer is below the threshold set by\nhighWaterMark, calls to writable.write() will return true. Once the\nthe size of the internal buffer reaches or exceeds the highWaterMark, false\nwill be returned.\nA key goal of the stream API, and in particular the stream.pipe() method,\nis to limit the buffering of data to acceptable levels such that sources and\ndestinations of differing speeds will not overwhelm the available memory.\nBecause Duplex and Transform streams are both Readable and Writable,\neach maintain two separate internal buffers used for reading and writing,\nallowing each side to operate independently of the other while maintaining an\nappropriate and efficient flow of data. For example, net.Socket instances\nare Duplex streams whose Readable side allows consumption of data received\nfrom the socket and whose Writable side allows writing data to the socket.\nBecause data may be written to the socket at a faster or slower rate than data\nis received, it is important each side operate (and buffer) independently of\nthe other.\nAPI for Stream Consumers\n\nAlmost all Node.js applications, no matter how simple, use streams in some\nmanner. The following is an example of using streams in a Node.js application\nthat implements an HTTP server:\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\n\nconst server = http.createServer( (req, res) =&gt; {\n  // req is an http.IncomingMessage, which is a Readable Stream\n  // res is an http.ServerResponse, which is a Writable Stream\n\n  let body = &#39;&#39;;\n  // Get the data as utf8 strings.\n  // If an encoding is not set, Buffer objects will be received.\n  req.setEncoding(&#39;utf8&#39;);\n\n  // Readable streams emit &#39;data&#39; events once a listener is added\n  req.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n    body += chunk;\n  });\n\n  // the end event indicates that the entire body has been received\n  req.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n    try {\n      const data = JSON.parse(body);\n    } catch (er) {\n      // uh oh!  bad json!\n      res.statusCode = 400;\n      return res.end(`error: ${er.message}`);\n    }\n\n    // write back something interesting to the user:\n    res.write(typeof data);\n    res.end();\n  });\n});\n\nserver.listen(1337);\n\n// $ curl localhost:1337 -d &#39;{}&#39;\n// object\n// $ curl localhost:1337 -d &#39;&quot;foo&quot;&#39;\n// string\n// $ curl localhost:1337 -d &#39;not json&#39;\n// error: Unexpected token o\n\nWritable streams (such as res in the example) expose methods such as\nwrite() and end() that are used to write data onto the stream.\nReadable streams use the EventEmitter API for notifying application\ncode when data is available to be read off the stream. That available data can\nbe read from the stream in multiple ways.\nBoth Writable and Readable streams use the EventEmitter API in\nvarious ways to communicate the current state of the stream.\nDuplex and Transform streams are both Writable and Readable.\nApplications that are either writing data to or consuming data from a stream\nare not required to implement the stream interfaces directly and will generally\nhave no reason to call require(&#39;stream&#39;).\nDevelopers wishing to implement new types of streams should refer to the\nsection API for Stream Implementers.\nWritable Streams\nWritable streams are an abstraction for a destination to which data is\nwritten.\nExamples of Writable streams include:\n\nHTTP requests, on the client\nHTTP responses, on the server\nfs write streams\nzlib streams\ncrypto streams\nTCP sockets\nchild process stdin\nprocess.stdout, process.stderr\n\nNote: Some of these examples are actually Duplex streams that implement\nthe Writable interface.\nAll Writable streams implement the interface defined by the\nstream.Writable class.\nWhile specific instances of Writable streams may differ in various ways,\nall Writable streams follow the same fundamental usage pattern as illustrated\nin the example below:\nconst myStream = getWritableStreamSomehow();\nmyStream.write(&#39;some data&#39;);\nmyStream.write(&#39;some more data&#39;);\nmyStream.end(&#39;done writing data&#39;);\n\nClass: stream.Writable\n\n\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nThe &#39;close&#39; event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying\nresources (a file descriptor, for example) have been closed. The event indicates\nthat no more events will be emitted, and no further computation will occur.\nNot all Writable streams will emit the &#39;close&#39; event.\nEvent: &#39;drain&#39;\n\nIf a call to stream.write(chunk) returns false, the\n&#39;drain&#39; event will be emitted when it is appropriate to resume writing data\nto the stream.\n// Write the data to the supplied writable stream one million times.\n// Be attentive to back-pressure.\nfunction writeOneMillionTimes(writer, data, encoding, callback) {\n  let i = 1000000;\n  write();\n  function write() {\n    var ok = true;\n    do {\n      i--;\n      if (i === 0) {\n        // last time!\n        writer.write(data, encoding, callback);\n      } else {\n        // see if we should continue, or wait\n        // don&#39;t pass the callback, because we&#39;re not done yet.\n        ok = writer.write(data, encoding);\n      }\n    } while (i &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; ok);\n    if (i &gt; 0) {\n      // had to stop early!\n      // write some more once it drains\n      writer.once(&#39;drain&#39;, write);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nEvent: &#39;error&#39;\n\n\n{Error}\n\nThe &#39;error&#39; event is emitted if an error occurred while writing or piping\ndata. The listener callback is passed a single Error argument when called.\nNote: The stream is not closed when the &#39;error&#39; event is emitted.\nEvent: &#39;finish&#39;\n\nThe &#39;finish&#39; event is emitted after the stream.end() method\nhas been called, and all data has been flushed to the underlying system.\nconst writer = getWritableStreamSomehow();\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i ++) {\n  writer.write(&#39;hello, #${i}!\\n&#39;);\n}\nwriter.end(&#39;This is the end\\n&#39;);\nwriter.on(&#39;finish&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.error(&#39;All writes are now complete.&#39;);\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;pipe&#39;\n\n\nsrc {stream.Readable} source stream that is piping to this writable\n\nThe &#39;pipe&#39; event is emitted when the stream.pipe() method is called on\na readable stream, adding this writable to its set of destinations.\nconst writer = getWritableStreamSomehow();\nconst reader = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nwriter.on(&#39;pipe&#39;, (src) =&gt; {\n  console.error(&#39;something is piping into the writer&#39;);\n  assert.equal(src, reader);\n});\nreader.pipe(writer);\n\nEvent: &#39;unpipe&#39;\n\n\nsrc {Readable Stream} The source stream that\nunpiped this writable\n\nThe &#39;unpipe&#39; event is emitted when the stream.unpipe() method is called\non a Readable stream, removing this Writable from its set of\ndestinations.\nconst writer = getWritableStreamSomehow();\nconst reader = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nwriter.on(&#39;unpipe&#39;, (src) =&gt; {\n  console.error(&#39;Something has stopped piping into the writer.&#39;);\n  assert.equal(src, reader);\n});\nreader.pipe(writer);\nreader.unpipe(writer);\n\nwritable.cork()\n\nThe writable.cork() method forces all written data to be buffered in memory.\nThe buffered data will be flushed when either the stream.uncork() or\nstream.end() methods are called.\nThe primary intent of writable.cork() is to avoid a situation where writing\nmany small chunks of data to a stream do not cause a backup in the internal\nbuffer that would have an adverse impact on performance. In such situations,\nimplementations that implement the writable._writev() method can perform\nbuffered writes in a more optimized manner.\nwritable.end([chunk][, encoding][, callback])\n\n\nchunk {String|Buffer|any} Optional data to write. For streams not operating\nin object mode, chunk must be a string or a Buffer. For object mode\nstreams, chunk may be any JavaScript value other than null.\nencoding {String} The encoding, if chunk is a String\ncallback {Function} Optional callback for when the stream is finished\n\nCalling the writable.end() method signals that no more data will be written\nto the Writable. The optional chunk and encoding arguments allow one\nfinal additional chunk of data to be written immediately before closing the\nstream. If provided, the optional callback function is attached as a listener\nfor the &#39;finish&#39; event.\nCalling the stream.write() method after calling\nstream.end() will raise an error.\n// write &#39;hello, &#39; and then end with &#39;world!&#39;\nconst file = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;example.txt&#39;);\nfile.write(&#39;hello, &#39;);\nfile.end(&#39;world!&#39;);\n// writing more now is not allowed!\n\nwritable.setDefaultEncoding(encoding)\n\n\nencoding {String} The new default encoding\nReturn: this\n\nThe writable.setDefaultEncoding() method sets the default encoding for a\nWritable stream.\nwritable.uncork()\n\nThe writable.uncork() method flushes all data buffered since\nstream.cork() was called.\nWhen using writable.cork() and writable.uncork() to manage the buffering\nof writes to a stream, it is recommended that calls to writable.uncork() be\ndeferred using process.nextTick(). Doing so allows batching of all\nwritable.write() calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.\nstream.cork();\nstream.write(&#39;some &#39;);\nstream.write(&#39;data &#39;);\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; stream.uncork());\n\nIf the writable.cork() method is called multiple times on a stream, the same\nnumber of calls to writable.uncork() must be called to flush the buffered\ndata.\nstream.cork();\nstream.write(&#39;some &#39;);\nstream.cork();\nstream.write(&#39;data &#39;);\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; {\n  stream.uncork();\n  // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.\n  stream.uncork();\n});\n\nwritable.write(chunk[, encoding][, callback])\n\n\nchunk {String|Buffer} The data to write\nencoding {String} The encoding, if chunk is a String\ncallback {Function} Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed\nReturns: {Boolean} false if the stream wishes for the calling code to\nwait for the &#39;drain&#39; event to be emitted before continuing to write\nadditional data; otherwise true.\n\nThe writable.write() method writes some data to the stream, and calls the\nsupplied callback once the data has been fully handled. If an error\noccurs, the callback may or may not be called with the error as its\nfirst argument. To reliably detect write errors, add a listener for the\n&#39;error&#39; event.\nThe return value indicates whether the written chunk was buffered internally\nand the buffer has exceeded the highWaterMark configured when the stream was\ncreated. If false is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream\nshould be paused until the &#39;drain&#39; event is emitted.\nA Writable stream in object mode will always ignore the encoding argument.\nReadable Streams\nReadable streams are an abstraction for a source from which data is\nconsumed.\nExamples of Readable streams include:\n\nHTTP responses, on the client\nHTTP requests, on the server\nfs read streams\nzlib streams\ncrypto streams\nTCP sockets\nchild process stdout and stderr\nprocess.stdin\n\nAll Readable streams implement the interface defined by the\nstream.Readable class.\nTwo Modes\nReadable streams effectively operate in one of two modes: flowing and paused.\nWhen in flowing mode, data is read from the underlying system automatically\nand provided to an application as quickly as possible using events via the\nEventEmitter interface.\nIn paused mode, the stream.read() method must be called\nexplicitly to read chunks of data from the stream.\nAll Readable streams begin in paused mode but can be switched to flowing\nmode in one of the following ways:\n\nAdding a &#39;data&#39; event handler.\nCalling the stream.resume() method.\nCalling the stream.pipe() method to send the data to a Writable.\n\nThe Readable can switch back to paused mode using one of the following:\n\nIf there are no pipe destinations, by calling the\nstream.pause() method.\nIf there are pipe destinations, by removing any &#39;data&#39; event\nhandlers, and removing all pipe destinations by calling the\nstream.unpipe() method.\n\nThe important concept to remember is that a Readable will not generate data\nuntil a mechanism for either consuming or ignoring that data is provided. If\nthe consuming mechanism is disabled or taken away, the Readable will attempt\nto stop generating the data.\nNote: For backwards compatibility reasons, removing &#39;data&#39; event\nhandlers will not automatically pause the stream. Also, if there are piped\ndestinations, then calling stream.pause() will not guarantee\nthat the stream will remain paused once those destinations drain and ask for\nmore data.\nNote: If a Readable is switched into flowing mode and there are no\nconsumers available handle the data, that data will be lost. This can occur,\nfor instance, when the readable.resume() method is called without a listener\nattached to the &#39;data&#39; event, or when a &#39;data&#39; event handler is removed\nfrom the stream.\nThree States\nThe &quot;two modes&quot; of operation for a Readable stream are a simplified abstraction\nfor the more complicated internal state management that is happening within the\nReadable stream implementation.\nSpecifically, at any given point in time, every Readable is in one of three\npossible states:\n\nreadable._readableState.flowing = null\nreadable._readableState.flowing = false\nreadable._readableState.flowing = true\n\nWhen readable._readableState.flowing is null, no mechanism for consuming the\nstreams data is provided so the stream will not generate its data.\nAttaching a listener for the &#39;data&#39; event, calling the readable.pipe()\nmethod, or calling the readable.resume() method will switch\nreadable._readableState.flowing to true, causing the Readable to begin\nactively emitting events as data is generated.\nCalling readable.pause(), readable.unpipe(), or receiving &quot;back pressure&quot;\nwill cause the readable._readableState.flowing to be set as false,\ntemporarily halting the flowing of events but not halting the generation of\ndata.\nWhile readable._readableState.flowing is false, data may be accumulating\nwithin the streams internal buffer.\nChoose One\nThe Readable stream API evolved across multiple Node.js versions and provides\nmultiple methods of consuming stream data. In general, developers should choose\none of the methods of consuming data and should never use multiple methods\nto consume data from a single stream.\nUse of the readable.pipe() method is recommended for most users as it has been\nimplemented to provide the easiest way of consuming stream data. Developers that\nrequire more fine-grained control over the transfer and generation of data can\nuse the EventEmitter and readable.pause()/readable.resume() APIs.\nClass: stream.Readable\n\n\nEvent: &#39;close&#39;\n\nThe &#39;close&#39; event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying\nresources (a file descriptor, for example) have been closed. The event indicates\nthat no more events will be emitted, and no further computation will occur.\nNot all Readable streams will emit the &#39;close&#39; event.\nEvent: &#39;data&#39;\n\n\nchunk {Buffer|String|any} The chunk of data. For streams that are not\noperating in object mode, the chunk will be either a string or Buffer.\nFor streams that are in object mode, the chunk can be any JavaScript value\nother than null.\n\nThe &#39;data&#39; event is emitted whenever the stream is relinquishing ownership of\na chunk of data to a consumer. This may occur whenever the stream is switched\nin flowing mode by calling readable.pipe(), readable.resume(), or by\nattaching a listener callback to the &#39;data&#39; event. The &#39;data&#39; event will\nalso be emitted whenever the readable.read() method is called and a chunk of\ndata is available to be returned.\nAttaching a &#39;data&#39; event listener to a stream that has not been explicitly\npaused will switch the stream into flowing mode. Data will then be passed as\nsoon as it is available.\nThe listener callback will be passed the chunk of data as a string if a default\nencoding has been specified for the stream using the\nreadable.setEncoding() method; otherwise the data will be passed as a\nBuffer.\nconst readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nreadable.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;end&#39;\n\nThe &#39;end&#39; event is emitted when there is no more data to be consumed from\nthe stream.\nNote: The &#39;end&#39; event will not be emitted unless the data is\ncompletely consumed. This can be accomplished by switching the stream into\nflowing mode, or by calling stream.read() repeatedly until\nall data has been consumed.\nconst readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nreadable.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);\n});\nreadable.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;There will be no more data.&#39;);\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;error&#39;\n\n\n{Error}\n\nThe &#39;error&#39; event may be emitted by a Readable implementation at any time.\nTypically, this may occur if the underlying stream in unable to generate data\ndue to an underlying internal failure, or when a stream implementation attempts\nto push an invalid chunk of data.\nThe listener callback will be passed a single Error object.\nEvent: &#39;readable&#39;\n\nThe &#39;readable&#39; event is emitted when there is data available to be read from\nthe stream. In some cases, attaching a listener for the &#39;readable&#39; event will\ncause some amount of data to be read into an internal buffer.\nconst readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nreadable.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  // there is some data to read now\n});\n\nThe &#39;readable&#39; event will also be emitted once the end of the stream data\nhas been reached but before the &#39;end&#39; event is emitted.\nEffectively, the &#39;readable&#39; event indicates that the stream has new\ninformation: either new data is available or the end of the stream has been\nreached. In the former case, stream.read() will return the\navailable data. In the latter case, stream.read() will return\nnull. For instance, in the following example, foo.txt is an empty file:\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nconst rr = fs.createReadStream(&#39;foo.txt&#39;);\nrr.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;readable:&#39;, rr.read());\n});\nrr.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;end&#39;);\n});\n\nThe output of running this script is:\n$ node test.js\nreadable: null\nend\n\nNote: In general, the readable.pipe() and &#39;data&#39; event mechanisms are\npreferred over the use of the &#39;readable&#39; event.\nreadable.isPaused()\n\n\nReturn: {Boolean}\n\nThe readable.isPaused() method returns the current operating state of the\nReadable. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the\nreadable.pipe() method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to\nuse this method directly.\nconst readable = new stream.Readable\n\nreadable.isPaused() // === false\nreadable.pause()\nreadable.isPaused() // === true\nreadable.resume()\nreadable.isPaused() // === false\n\nreadable.pause()\n\n\nReturn: this\n\nThe readable.pause() method will cause a stream in flowing mode to stop\nemitting &#39;data&#39; events, switching out of flowing mode. Any data that\nbecomes available will remain in the internal buffer.\nconst readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nreadable.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);\n  readable.pause();\n  console.log(&#39;There will be no additional data for 1 second.&#39;);\n  setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;Now data will start flowing again.&#39;);\n    readable.resume();\n  }, 1000);\n});\n\nreadable.pipe(destination[, options])\n\n\ndestination {stream.Writable} The destination for writing data\noptions {Object} Pipe options\nend {Boolean} End the writer when the reader ends. Defaults to true.\n\n\n\nThe readable.pipe() method attaches a Writable stream to the readable,\ncausing it to switch automatically into flowing mode and push all of its data\nto the attached Writable. The flow of data will be automatically managed so\nthat the destination Writable stream is not overwhelmed by a faster Readable\nstream.\nThe following example pipes all of the data from the readable into a file\nnamed file.txt:\nconst readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nconst writable = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;file.txt&#39;);\n// All the data from readable goes into &#39;file.txt&#39;\nreadable.pipe(writable);\n\nIt is possible to attach multiple Writable streams to a single Readable stream.\nThe readable.pipe() method returns a reference to the destination stream\nmaking it possible to set up chains of piped streams:\nconst r = fs.createReadStream(&#39;file.txt&#39;);\nconst z = zlib.createGzip();\nconst w = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;file.txt.gz&#39;);\nr.pipe(z).pipe(w);\n\nBy default, stream.end() is called on the destination Writable\nstream when the source Readable stream emits &#39;end&#39;, so that the\ndestination is no longer writable. To disable this default behavior, the end\noption can be passed as false, causing the destination stream to remain open,\nas illustrated in the following example:\nreader.pipe(writer, { end: false });\nreader.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  writer.end(&#39;Goodbye\\n&#39;);\n});\n\nOne important caveat is that if the Readable stream emits an error during\nprocessing, the Writable destination is not closed automatically. If an\nerror occurs, it will be necessary to manually close each stream in order\nto prevent memory leaks.\nNote: The process.stderr and process.stdout Writable streams are\nnever closed until the Node.js process exits, regardless of the specified\noptions.\nreadable.read([size])\n\n\nsize {Number} Optional argument to specify how much data to read.\nReturn {String|Buffer|Null}\n\nThe readable.read() method pulls some data out of the internal buffer and\nreturns it. If no data available to be read, null is returned. By default,\nthe data will be returned as a Buffer object unless an encoding has been\nspecified using the readable.setEncoding() method or the stream is operating\nin object mode.\nThe optional size argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If\nsize bytes are not available to be read, null will be returned unless\nthe stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal\nbuffer will be returned (even if it exceeds size bytes).\nIf the size argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the\ninternal buffer will be returned.\nThe readable.read() method should only be called on Readable streams operating\nin paused mode. In flowing mode, readable.read() is called automatically until\nthe internal buffer is fully drained.\nconst readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nreadable.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  var chunk;\n  while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {\n    console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);\n  }\n});\n\nIn general, it is recommended that developers avoid the use of the &#39;readable&#39;\nevent and the readable.read() method in favor of using either\nreadable.pipe() or the &#39;data&#39; event.\nA Readable stream in object mode will always return a single item from\na call to readable.read(size), regardless of the value of the\nsize argument.\nNote: If the readable.read() method returns a chunk of data, a &#39;data&#39;\nevent will also be emitted.\nNote: Calling stream.read([size]) after the &#39;end&#39;\nevent has been emitted will return null. No runtime error will be raised.\nreadable.resume()\n\n\nReturn: this\n\nThe readable.resume() method causes an explicitly paused Readable stream to\nresume emitting &#39;data&#39; events, switching the stream into flowing mode.\nThe readable.resume() method can be used to fully consume the data from a\nstream without actually processing any of that data as illustrated in the\nfollowing example:\ngetReadableStreamSomehow()\n  .resume()\n  .on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;Reached the end, but did not read anything.&#39;);\n  });\n\nreadable.setEncoding(encoding)\n\n\nencoding {String} The encoding to use.\nReturn: this\n\nThe readable.setEncoding() method sets the default character encoding for\ndata read from the Readable stream.\nSetting an encoding causes the stream data\nto be returned as string of the specified encoding rather than as Buffer\nobjects. For instance, calling readable.setEncoding(&#39;utf8&#39;) will cause the\noutput data will be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling\nreadable.setEncoding(&#39;hex&#39;) will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal\nstring format.\nThe Readable stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through\nthe stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from\nthe stream as Buffer objects.\nEncoding can be disabled by calling readable.setEncoding(null). This approach\nis useful when working with binary data or with large multi-byte strings spread\nout over multiple chunks.\nconst readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nreadable.setEncoding(&#39;utf8&#39;);\nreadable.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n  assert.equal(typeof chunk, &#39;string&#39;);\n  console.log(&#39;got %d characters of string data&#39;, chunk.length);\n});\n\nreadable.unpipe([destination])\n\n\ndestination {stream.Writable} Optional specific stream to unpipe\n\nThe readable.unpipe() method detaches a Writable stream previously attached\nusing the stream.pipe() method.\nIf the destination is not specified, then all pipes are detached.\nIf the destination is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then\nthe method does nothing.\nconst readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();\nconst writable = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;file.txt&#39;);\n// All the data from readable goes into &#39;file.txt&#39;,\n// but only for the first second\nreadable.pipe(writable);\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Stop writing to file.txt&#39;);\n  readable.unpipe(writable);\n  console.log(&#39;Manually close the file stream&#39;);\n  writable.end();\n}, 1000);\n\nreadable.unshift(chunk)\n\n\nchunk {Buffer|String} Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue\n\nThe readable.unshift() method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal\nbuffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by\ncode that needs to &quot;un-consume&quot; some amount of data that it has optimistically\npulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.\nNote: The stream.unshift(chunk) method cannot be called after the\n&#39;end&#39; event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.\nDevelopers using stream.unshift() often should consider switching to\nuse of a Transform stream instead. See the API for Stream Implementers\nsection for more information.\n// Pull off a header delimited by \\n\\n\n// use unshift() if we get too much\n// Call the callback with (error, header, stream)\nconst StringDecoder = require(&#39;string_decoder&#39;).StringDecoder;\nfunction parseHeader(stream, callback) {\n  stream.on(&#39;error&#39;, callback);\n  stream.on(&#39;readable&#39;, onReadable);\n  const decoder = new StringDecoder(&#39;utf8&#39;);\n  var header = &#39;&#39;;\n  function onReadable() {\n    var chunk;\n    while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {\n      var str = decoder.write(chunk);\n      if (str.match(/\\n\\n/)) {\n        // found the header boundary\n        var split = str.split(/\\n\\n/);\n        header += split.shift();\n        const remaining = split.join(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;);\n        const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, &#39;utf8&#39;);\n        if (buf.length)\n          stream.unshift(buf);\n        stream.removeListener(&#39;error&#39;, callback);\n        stream.removeListener(&#39;readable&#39;, onReadable);\n        // now the body of the message can be read from the stream.\n        callback(null, header, stream);\n      } else {\n        // still reading the header.\n        header += str;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNote: Unlike stream.push(chunk), stream.unshift(chunk)\nwill not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the\nstream. This can cause unexpected results if readable.unshift() is called\nduring a read (i.e. from within a stream._read()\nimplementation on a custom stream). Following the call to readable.unshift()\nwith an immediate stream.push(&#39;&#39;) will reset the reading state\nappropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling readable.unshift()\nwhile in the process of performing a read.\nreadable.wrap(stream)\n\n\nstream {Stream} An &quot;old style&quot; readable stream\n\nVersions of Node.js prior to v0.10 had streams that did not implement the\nentire stream module API as it is currently defined. (See Compatibility\nfor more information.)\nWhen using an older Node.js library that emits &#39;data&#39; events and has a\nstream.pause() method that is advisory only, the\nreadable.wrap() method can be used to create a Readable stream that uses\nthe old stream as its data source.\nIt will rarely be necessary to use readable.wrap() but the method has been\nprovided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and\nlibraries.\nFor example:\nconst OldReader = require(&#39;./old-api-module.js&#39;).OldReader;\nconst Readable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Readable;\nconst oreader = new OldReader;\nconst myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);\n\nmyReader.on(&#39;readable&#39;, () =&gt; {\n  myReader.read(); // etc.\n});\n\nDuplex and Transform Streams\nClass: stream.Duplex\n\n\nDuplex streams are streams that implement both the Readable and\nWritable interfaces.\nExamples of Duplex streams include:\n\nTCP sockets\nzlib streams\ncrypto streams\n\nClass: stream.Transform\n\n\nTransform streams are Duplex streams where the output is in some way\nrelated to the input. Like all Duplex streams, Transform streams\nimplement both the Readable and Writable interfaces.\nExamples of Transform streams include:\n\nzlib streams\ncrypto streams\n\nAPI for Stream Implementers\n\nThe stream module API has been designed to make it possible to easily\nimplement streams using JavaScript&#39;s prototypical inheritance model.\nFirst, a stream developer would declare a new JavaScript class that extends one\nof the four basic stream classes (stream.Writable, stream.Readable,\nstream.Duplex, or stream.Transform), making sure the call the appropriate\nparent class constructor:\nconst Writable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Writable;\n\nclass MyWritable extends Writable {\n  constructor(options) {\n    super(options);\n  }\n}\n\nThe new stream class must then implement one or more specific methods, depending\non the type of stream being created, as detailed in the chart below:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Use-case\n      \n      \n        Class\n      \n      \n        Method(s) to implement\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Reading only\n    \n    \n      [Readable](#stream_class_stream_readable)\n    \n    \n      [_read][stream-_read]\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Writing only\n    \n    \n      [Writable](#stream_class_stream_writable)\n    \n    \n      [_write][stream-_write], [_writev][stream-_writev]\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Reading and writing\n    \n    \n      [Duplex](#stream_class_stream_duplex)\n    \n    \n      [_read][stream-_read], [_write][stream-_write], [_writev][stream-_writev]\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Operate on written data, then read the result\n    \n    \n      [Transform](#stream_class_stream_transform)\n    \n    \n      [_transform][stream-_transform], [_flush][stream-_flush]\n    \n  \n\n\nNote: The implementation code for a stream should never call the &quot;public&quot;\nmethods of a stream that are intended for use by consumers (as described in\nthe API for Stream Consumers section). Doing so may lead to adverse\nside effects in application code consuming the stream.\nSimplified Construction\nFor many simple cases, it is possible to construct a stream without relying on\ninheritance. This can be accomplished by directly creating instances of the\nstream.Writable, stream.Readable, stream.Duplex or stream.Transform\nobjects and passing appropriate methods as constructor options.\nFor example:\nconst Writable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Writable;\n\nconst myWritable = new Writable({\n  write(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n\nImplementing a Writable Stream\nThe stream.Writable class is extended to implement a Writable stream.\nCustom Writable streams must call the new stream.Writable([options])\nconstructor and implement the writable._write() method. The\nwritable._writev() method may also be implemented.\nConstructor: new stream.Writable([options])\n\noptions {Object}\nhighWaterMark {Number} Buffer level when\nstream.write() starts returning false. Defaults to\n16384 (16kb), or 16 for objectMode streams.\ndecodeStrings {Boolean} Whether or not to decode strings into\nBuffers before passing them to stream._write().\nDefaults to true\nobjectMode {Boolean} Whether or not the\nstream.write(anyObj) is a valid operation. When set,\nit becomes possible to write JavaScript values other than string or\nBuffer if supported by the stream implementation. Defaults to false\nwrite {Function} Implementation for the\nstream._write() method.\nwritev {Function} Implementation for the\nstream._writev() method.\n\n\n\nFor example:\nconst Writable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Writable;\n\nclass MyWritable extends Writable {\n  constructor(options) {\n    // Calls the stream.Writable() constructor\n    super(options);\n  }\n}\n\nOr, when using pre-ES6 style constructors:\nconst Writable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Writable;\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nfunction MyWritable(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MyWritable))\n    return new MyWritable(options);\n  Writable.call(this, options);\n}\nutil.inherits(MyWritable, Writable);\n\nOr, using the Simplified Constructor approach:\nconst Writable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Writable;\n\nconst myWritable = new Writable({\n  write(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  writev(chunks, callback) {\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n\nwritable._write(chunk, encoding, callback)\n\nchunk {Buffer|String} The chunk to be written. Will always\nbe a buffer unless the decodeStrings option was set to false.\nencoding {String} If the chunk is a string, then encoding is the\ncharacter encoding of that string. If chunk is a Buffer, or if the\nstream is operating in object mode, encoding may be ignored.\ncallback {Function} Call this function (optionally with an error\nargument) when processing is complete for the supplied chunk.\n\nAll Writable stream implementations must provide a\nwritable._write() method to send data to the underlying\nresource.\nNote: Transform streams provide their own implementation of the\nwritable._write().\nNote: This function MUST NOT be called by application code directly. It\nshould be implemented by child classes, and called only by the internal Writable\nclass methods only.\nThe callback method must be called to signal either that the write completed\nsuccessfully or failed with an error. The first argument passed to the\ncallback must be the Error object if the call failed or null if the\nwrite succeeded.\nIt is important to note that all calls to writable.write() that occur between\nthe time writable._write() is called and the callback is called will cause\nthe written data to be buffered. Once the callback is invoked, the stream will\nemit a &#39;drain&#39; event. If a stream implementation is capable of processing\nmultiple chunks of data at once, the writable._writev() method should be\nimplemented.\nIf the decodeStrings property is set in the constructor options, then\nchunk may be a string rather than a Buffer, and encoding will\nindicate the character encoding of the string. This is to support\nimplementations that have an optimized handling for certain string\ndata encodings. If the decodeStrings property is explicitly set to false,\nthe encoding argument can be safely ignored, and chunk will always be a\nBuffer.\nThe writable._write() method is prefixed with an underscore because it is\ninternal to the class that defines it, and should never be called directly by\nuser programs.\nwritable._writev(chunks, callback)\n\nchunks {Array} The chunks to be written. Each chunk has following\nformat: { chunk: ..., encoding: ... }.\ncallback {Function} A callback function (optionally with an error\nargument) to be invoked when processing is complete for the supplied chunks.\n\nNote: This function MUST NOT be called by application code directly. It\nshould be implemented by child classes, and called only by the internal Writable\nclass methods only.\nThe writable._writev() method may be implemented in addition to\nwritable._write() in stream implementations that are capable of processing\nmultiple chunks of data at once. If implemented, the method will be called with\nall chunks of data currently buffered in the write queue.\nThe writable._writev() method is prefixed with an underscore because it is\ninternal to the class that defines it, and should never be called directly by\nuser programs.\nErrors While Writing\nIt is recommended that errors occurring during the processing of the\nwritable._write() and writable._writev() methods are reported by invoking\nthe callback and passing the error as the first argument. This will cause an\n&#39;error&#39; event to be emitted by the Writable. Throwing an Error from within\nwritable._write() can result in expected and inconsistent behavior depending\non how the stream is being used.  Using the callback ensures consistent and\npredictable handling of errors.\nconst Writable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Writable;\n\nconst myWritable = new Writable({\n  write(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    if (chunk.toString().indexOf(&#39;a&#39;) &gt;= 0) {\n      callback(new Error(&#39;chunk is invalid&#39;));\n    } else {\n      callback();\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nAn Example Writable Stream\nThe following illustrates a rather simplistic (and somewhat pointless) custom\nWritable stream implementation. While this specific Writable stream instance\nis not of any real particular usefulness, the example illustrates each of the\nrequired elements of a custom Writable stream instance:\nconst Writable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Writable;\n\nclass MyWritable extends Writable {\n  constructor(options) {\n    super(options);\n  }\n\n  _write(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    if (chunk.toString().indexOf(&#39;a&#39;) &gt;= 0) {\n      callback(new Error(&#39;chunk is invalid&#39;));\n    } else {\n      callback();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nImplementing a Readable Stream\nThe stream.Readable class is extended to implement a Readable stream.\nCustom Readable streams must call the new stream.Readable([options])\nconstructor and implement the readable._read() method.\nnew stream.Readable([options])\n\noptions {Object}\nhighWaterMark {Number} The maximum number of bytes to store in\nthe internal buffer before ceasing to read from the underlying\nresource. Defaults to 16384 (16kb), or 16 for objectMode streams\nencoding {String} If specified, then buffers will be decoded to\nstrings using the specified encoding. Defaults to null\nobjectMode {Boolean} Whether this stream should behave\nas a stream of objects. Meaning that stream.read(n) returns\na single value instead of a Buffer of size n. Defaults to false\nread {Function} Implementation for the stream._read()\nmethod.\n\n\n\nFor example:\nconst Readable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Readable;\n\nclass MyReadable extends Readable {\n  constructor(options) {\n    // Calls the stream.Readable(options) constructor\n    super(options);\n  }\n}\n\nOr, when using pre-ES6 style constructors:\nconst Readable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Readable;\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nfunction MyReadable(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MyReadable))\n    return new MyReadable(options);\n  Readable.call(this, options);\n}\nutil.inherits(MyReadable, Readable);\n\nOr, using the Simplified Constructor approach:\nconst Readable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Readable;\n\nconst myReadable = new Readable({\n  read(size) {\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n\nreadable._read(size)\n\nsize {Number} Number of bytes to read asynchronously\n\nNote: This function MUST NOT be called by application code directly. It\nshould be implemented by child classes, and called only by the internal Readable\nclass methods only.\nAll Readable stream implementations must provide an implementation of the\nreadable._read() method to fetch data from the underlying resource.\nWhen readable._read() is called, if data is available from the resource, the\nimplementation should begin pushing that data into the read queue using the\nthis.push(dataChunk) method. _read() should continue reading\nfrom the resource and pushing data until readable.push() returns false. Only\nwhen _read() is called again after it has stopped should it resume pushing\nadditional data onto the queue.\nNote: Once the readable._read() method has been called, it will not be\ncalled again until the readable.push() method is called.\nThe size argument is advisory. For implementations where a &quot;read&quot; is a\nsingle operation that returns data can use the size argument to determine how\nmuch data to fetch. Other implementations may ignore this argument and simply\nprovide data whenever it becomes available. There is no need to &quot;wait&quot; until\nsize bytes are available before calling stream.push(chunk).\nThe readable._read() method is prefixed with an underscore because it is\ninternal to the class that defines it, and should never be called directly by\nuser programs.\nreadable.push(chunk[, encoding])\n\nchunk {Buffer|Null|String} Chunk of data to push into the read queue\nencoding {String} Encoding of String chunks.  Must be a valid\nBuffer encoding, such as &#39;utf8&#39; or &#39;ascii&#39;\nReturns {Boolean} true if additional chunks of data may continued to be\npushed; false otherwise.\n\nWhen chunk is a Buffer or string, the chunk of data will be added to the\ninternal queue for users of the stream to consume. Passing chunk as null\nsignals the end of the stream (EOF), after which no more data can be written.\nWhen the Readable is operating in paused mode, the data added with\nreadable.push() can be read out by calling the\nreadable.read() method when the &#39;readable&#39; event is\nemitted.\nWhen the Readable is operating in flowing mode, the data added with\nreadable.push() will be delivered by emitting a &#39;data&#39; event.\nThe readable.push() method is designed to be as flexible as possible. For\nexample, when wrapping a lower-level source that provides some form of\npause/resume mechanism, and a data callback, the low-level source can be wrapped\nby the custom Readable instance as illustrated in the following example:\n// source is an object with readStop() and readStart() methods,\n// and an `ondata` member that gets called when it has data, and\n// an `onend` member that gets called when the data is over.\n\nclass SourceWrapper extends Readable {\n  constructor(options) {\n    super(options);\n\n    this._source = getLowlevelSourceObject();\n\n    // Every time there&#39;s data, push it into the internal buffer.\n    this._source.ondata = (chunk) =&gt; {\n      // if push() returns false, then stop reading from source\n      if (!this.push(chunk))\n        this._source.readStop();\n    };\n\n    // When the source ends, push the EOF-signaling `null` chunk\n    this._source.onend = () =&gt; {\n      this.push(null);\n    };\n  }\n  // _read will be called when the stream wants to pull more data in\n  // the advisory size argument is ignored in this case.\n  _read(size) {\n    this._source.readStart();\n  }\n}\n\nNote: The readable.push() method is intended be called only by Readable\nImplementers, and only from within the readable._read() method.\nErrors While Reading\nIt is recommended that errors occurring during the processing of the\nreadable._read() method are emitted using the &#39;error&#39; event rather than\nbeing thrown. Throwing an Error from within readable._read() can result in\nexpected and inconsistent behavior depending on whether the stream is operating\nin flowing or paused mode. Using the &#39;error&#39; event ensures consistent and\npredictable handling of errors.\nconst Readable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Readable;\n\nconst myReadable = new Readable({\n  read(size) {\n    if (checkSomeErrorCondition()) {\n      process.nextTick(() =&gt; this.emit(&#39;error&#39;, err));\n      return;\n    }\n    // do some work\n  }\n});\n\nAn Example Counting Stream\n\nThe following is a basic example of a Readable stream that emits the numerals\nfrom 1 to 1,000,000 in ascending order, and then ends.\nconst Readable = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Readable;\n\nclass Counter extends Readable {\n  constructor(opt) {\n    super(opt);\n    this._max = 1000000;\n    this._index = 1;\n  }\n\n  _read() {\n    var i = this._index++;\n    if (i &gt; this._max)\n      this.push(null);\n    else {\n      var str = &#39;&#39; + i;\n      var buf = Buffer.from(str, &#39;ascii&#39;);\n      this.push(buf);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nImplementing a Duplex Stream\nA Duplex stream is one that implements both Readable and Writable,\nsuch as a TCP socket connection.\nBecause JavaScript does not have support for multiple inheritance, the\nstream.Duplex class is extended to implement a Duplex stream (as opposed\nto extending the stream.Readable and stream.Writable classes).\nNote: The stream.Duplex class prototypically inherits from stream.Readable\nand parasitically from stream.Writable.\nCustom Duplex streams must call the new stream.Duplex([options])\nconstructor and implement both the readable._read() and\nwritable._write() methods.\nnew stream.Duplex(options)\n\noptions {Object} Passed to both Writable and Readable\nconstructors. Also has the following fields:\nallowHalfOpen {Boolean} Defaults to true. If set to false, then\nthe stream will automatically end the readable side when the\nwritable side ends and vice versa.\nreadableObjectMode {Boolean} Defaults to false. Sets objectMode\nfor readable side of the stream. Has no effect if objectMode\nis true.\nwritableObjectMode {Boolean} Defaults to false. Sets objectMode\nfor writable side of the stream. Has no effect if objectMode\nis true.\n\n\n\nFor example:\nconst Duplex = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Duplex;\n\nclass MyDuplex extends Duplex {\n  constructor(options) {\n    super(options);\n  }\n}\n\nOr, when using pre-ES6 style constructors:\nconst Duplex = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Duplex;\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nfunction MyDuplex(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MyDuplex))\n    return new MyDuplex(options);\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n}\nutil.inherits(MyDuplex, Duplex);\n\nOr, using the Simplified Constructor approach:\nconst Duplex = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Duplex;\n\nconst myDuplex = new Duplex({\n  read(size) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  write(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n\nAn Example Duplex Stream\nThe following illustrates a simple example of a Duplex stream that wraps a\nhypothetical lower-level source object to which data can be written, and\nfrom which data can be read, albeit using an API that is not compatible with\nNode.js streams.\nThe following illustrates a simple example of a Duplex stream that buffers\nincoming written data via the Writable interface that is read back out\nvia the Readable interface.\nconst Duplex = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Duplex;\nconst kSource = Symbol(&#39;source&#39;);\n\nclass MyDuplex extends Duplex {\n  constructor(source, options) {\n    super(options);\n    this[kSource] = source;\n  }\n\n  _write(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    // The underlying source only deals with strings\n    if (Buffer.isBuffer(chunk))\n      chunk = chunk.toString(encoding);\n    this[kSource].writeSomeData(chunk, encoding);\n    callback();\n  }\n\n  _read(size) {\n    this[kSource].fetchSomeData(size, (data, encoding) =&gt; {\n      this.push(Buffer.from(data, encoding));\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nThe most important aspect of a Duplex stream is that the Readable and Writable\nsides operate independently of one another despite co-existing within a single\nobject instance.\nObject Mode Duplex Streams\nFor Duplex streams, objectMode can be set exclusively for either the Readable\nor Writable side using the readableObjectMode and writableObjectMode options\nrespectively.\nIn the following example, for instance, a new Transform stream (which is a\ntype of Duplex stream) is created that has an object mode Writable side\nthat accepts JavaScript numbers that are converted to hexidecimal strings on\nthe Readable side.\nconst Transform = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Transform;\n\n// All Transform streams are also Duplex Streams\nconst myTransform = new Transform({\n  writableObjectMode: true,\n\n  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    // Coerce the chunk to a number if necessary\n    chunk |= 0;\n\n    // Transform the chunk into something else.\n    const data = chunk.toString(16);\n\n    // Push the data onto the readable queue.\n    callback(null, &#39;0&#39;.repeat(data.length % 2) + data);\n  }\n});\n\nmyTransform.setEncoding(&#39;ascii&#39;);\nmyTransform.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&gt; console.log(chunk));\n\nmyTransform.write(1);\n  // Prints: 01\nmyTransform.write(10);\n  // Prints: 0a\nmyTransform.write(100);\n  // Prints: 64\n\nImplementing a Transform Stream\nA Transform stream is a Duplex stream where the output is computed\nin some way from the input. Examples include zlib streams or crypto\nstreams that compress, encrypt, or decrypt data.\nNote: There is no requirement that the output be the same size as the input,\nthe same number of chunks, or arrive at the same time. For example, a\nHash stream will only ever have a single chunk of output which is\nprovided when the input is ended. A zlib stream will produce output\nthat is either much smaller or much larger than its input.\nThe stream.Transform class is extended to implement a Transform stream.\nThe stream.Transform class prototypically inherits from stream.Duplex and\nimplements its own versions of the writable._write() and readable._read()\nmethods. Custom Transform implementations must implement the\ntransform._transform() method and may also implement\nthe transform._flush() method.\nNote: Care must be taken when using Transform streams in that data written\nto the stream can cause the Writable side of the stream to become paused if\nthe output on the Readable side is not consumed.\nnew stream.Transform([options])\n\noptions {Object} Passed to both Writable and Readable\nconstructors. Also has the following fields:\ntransform {Function} Implementation for the\nstream._transform() method.\nflush {Function} Implementation for the stream._flush()\nmethod.\n\n\n\nFor example:\nconst Transform = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Transform;\n\nclass MyTransform extends Transform {\n  constructor(options) {\n    super(options);\n  }\n}\n\nOr, when using pre-ES6 style constructors:\nconst Transform = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Transform;\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nfunction MyTransform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MyTransform))\n    return new MyTransform(options);\n  Transform.call(this, options);\n}\nutil.inherits(MyTransform, Transform);\n\nOr, using the Simplified Constructor approach:\nconst Transform = require(&#39;stream&#39;).Transform;\n\nconst myTransform = new Transform({\n  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n\nEvents: &#39;finish&#39; and &#39;end&#39;\nThe &#39;finish&#39; and &#39;end&#39; events are from the stream.Writable\nand stream.Readable classes, respectively. The &#39;finish&#39; event is emitted\nafter stream.end() is called and all chunks have been processed\nby stream._transform(). The &#39;end&#39; event is emitted\nafter all data has been output, which occurs after the callback in\ntransform._flush() has been called.\ntransform._flush(callback)\n\ncallback {Function} A callback function (optionally with an error\nargument and data) to be called when remaining data has been flushed.\n\nNote: This function MUST NOT be called by application code directly. It\nshould be implemented by child classes, and called only by the internal Readable\nclass methods only.\nIn some cases, a transform operation may need to emit an additional bit of\ndata at the end of the stream. For example, a zlib compression stream will\nstore an amount of internal state used to optimally compress the output. When\nthe stream ends, however, that additional data needs to be flushed so that the\ncompressed data will be complete.\nCustom Transform implementations may implement the transform._flush()\nmethod. This will be called when there is no more written data to be consumed,\nbut before the &#39;end&#39; event is emitted signaling the end of the\nReadable stream.\nWithin the transform._flush() implementation, the readable.push() method\nmay be called zero or more times, as appropriate. The callback function must\nbe called when the flush operation is complete.\nThe transform._flush() method is prefixed with an underscore because it is\ninternal to the class that defines it, and should never be called directly by\nuser programs.\ntransform._transform(chunk, encoding, callback)\n\nchunk {Buffer|String} The chunk to be transformed. Will always\nbe a buffer unless the decodeStrings option was set to false.\nencoding {String} If the chunk is a string, then this is the\nencoding type. If chunk is a buffer, then this is the special\nvalue - &#39;buffer&#39;, ignore it in this case.\ncallback {Function} A callback function (optionally with an error\nargument and data) to be called after the supplied chunk has been\nprocessed.\n\nNote: This function MUST NOT be called by application code directly. It\nshould be implemented by child classes, and called only by the internal Readable\nclass methods only.\nAll Transform stream implementations must provide a _transform()\nmethod to accept input and produce output. The transform._transform()\nimplementation handles the bytes being written, computes an output, then passes\nthat output off to the readable portion using the readable.push() method.\nThe transform.push() method may be called zero or more times to generate\noutput from a single input chunk, depending on how much is to be output\nas a result of the chunk.\nIt is possible that no output is generated from any given chunk of input data.\nThe callback function must be called only when the current chunk is completely\nconsumed. The first argument passed to the callback must be an Error object\nif an error occurred while processing the input or null otherwise. If a second\nargument is passed to the callback, it will be forwarded on to the\nreadable.push() method. In other words the following are equivalent:\ntransform.prototype._transform = function (data, encoding, callback) {\n  this.push(data);\n  callback();\n};\n\ntransform.prototype._transform = function (data, encoding, callback) {\n  callback(null, data);\n};\n\nThe transform._transform() method is prefixed with an underscore because it\nis internal to the class that defines it, and should never be called directly by\nuser programs.\nClass: stream.PassThrough\nThe stream.PassThrough class is a trivial implementation of a Transform\nstream that simply passes the input bytes across to the output. Its purpose is\nprimarily for examples and testing, but there are some use cases where\nstream.PassThrough is useful as a building block for novel sorts of streams.\nAdditional Notes\n\nCompatibility with Older Node.js Versions\n\nIn versions of Node.js prior to v0.10, the Readable stream interface was\nsimpler, but also less powerful and less useful.\n\nRather than waiting for calls the stream.read() method,\n&#39;data&#39; events would begin emitting immediately. Applications that\nwould need to perform some amount of work to decide how to handle data\nwere required to store read data into buffers so the data would not be lost.\nThe stream.pause() method was advisory, rather than\nguaranteed. This meant that it was still necessary to be prepared to receive\n&#39;data&#39; events even when the stream was in a paused state.\n\nIn Node.js v0.10, the Readable class was added. For backwards compatibility\nwith older Node.js programs, Readable streams switch into &quot;flowing mode&quot; when a\n&#39;data&#39; event handler is added, or when the\nstream.resume() method is called. The effect is that, even\nwhen not using the new stream.read() method and\n&#39;readable&#39; event, it is no longer necessary to worry about losing\n&#39;data&#39; chunks.\nWhile most applications will continue to function normally, this introduces an\nedge case in the following conditions:\n\nNo &#39;data&#39; event listener is added.\nThe stream.resume() method is never called.\nThe stream is not piped to any writable destination.\n\nFor example, consider the following code:\n// WARNING!  BROKEN!\nnet.createServer((socket) =&gt; {\n\n  // we add an &#39;end&#39; method, but never consume the data\n  socket.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n    // It will never get here.\n    socket.end(&#39;The message was received but was not processed.\\n&#39;);\n  });\n\n}).listen(1337);\n\nIn versions of Node.js prior to v0.10, the incoming message data would be\nsimply discarded. However, in Node.js v0.10 and beyond, the socket remains\npaused forever.\nThe workaround in this situation is to call the\nstream.resume() method to begin the flow of data:\n// Workaround\nnet.createServer((socket) =&gt; {\n\n  socket.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; {\n    socket.end(&#39;The message was received but was not processed.\\n&#39;);\n  });\n\n  // start the flow of data, discarding it.\n  socket.resume();\n\n}).listen(1337);\n\nIn addition to new Readable streams switching into flowing mode,\npre-v0.10 style streams can be wrapped in a Readable class using the\nreadable.wrap() method.\nreadable.read(0)\nThere are some cases where it is necessary to trigger a refresh of the\nunderlying readable stream mechanisms, without actually consuming any\ndata. In such cases, it is possible to call readable.read(0), which will\nalways return null.\nIf the internal read buffer is below the highWaterMark, and the\nstream is not currently reading, then calling stream.read(0) will trigger\na low-level stream._read() call.\nWhile most applications will almost never need to do this, there are\nsituations within Node.js where this is done, particularly in the\nReadable stream class internals.\nreadable.push(&#39;&#39;)\nUse of readable.push(&#39;&#39;) is not recommended.\nPushing a zero-byte string or Buffer to a stream that is not in object mode\nhas an interesting side effect. Because it is a call to\nreadable.push(), the call will end the reading process.\nHowever, because the argument is an empty string, no data is added to the\nreadable buffer so there is nothing for a user to consume.\n"},"string_decoder.html":{"url":"string_decoder.html","title":"String Decoder","body":"title: string_decoder\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nStringDecoder\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe string_decoder module provides an API for decoding Buffer objects into\nstrings in a manner that preserves encoded multi-byte UTF-8 and UTF-16\ncharacters. It can be accessed using:\nconst StringDecoder = require(&#39;string_decoder&#39;).StringDecoder;\n\nThe following example shows the basic use of the StringDecoder class.\nconst StringDecoder = require(&#39;string_decoder&#39;).StringDecoder;\nconst decoder = new StringDecoder(&#39;utf8&#39;);\n\nconst cent = Buffer.from([0xC2, 0xA2]);\nconsole.log(decoder.write(cent));\n\nconst euro = Buffer.from([0xE2, 0x82, 0xAC]);\nconsole.log(decoder.write(euro));\n\nWhen a Buffer instance is written to the StringDecoder instance, an\ninternal buffer is used to ensure that the decoded string does not contain\nany incomplete multibyte characters. These are held in the buffer until the\nnext call to stringDecoder.write() or until stringDecoder.end() is called.\nIn the following example, the three UTF-8 encoded bytes of the European Euro\nsymbol (€) are written over three separate operations:\nconst StringDecoder = require(&#39;string_decoder&#39;).StringDecoder;\nconst decoder = new StringDecoder(&#39;utf8&#39;);\n\ndecoder.write(Buffer.from([0xE2]));\ndecoder.write(Buffer.from([0x82]));\nconsole.log(decoder.end(Buffer.from([0xAC])));\n\nClass: new StringDecoder([encoding])\n\n\nencoding {string} The character encoding the StringDecoder will use.\nDefaults to &#39;utf8&#39;.\n\nCreates a new StringDecoder instance.\nstringDecoder.end([buffer])\n\n\nbuffer {Buffer} A Buffer containing the bytes to decode.\n\nReturns any remaining input stored in the internal buffer as a string.

For most common\ncases, each client and server must have a private key.\nPrivate keys can be generated in multiple ways. The example below illustrates\nuse of the OpenSSL command-line interface to generate a 2048-bit RSA private\nkey:\nopenssl genrsa -out ryans-key.pem 2048\n\nWith TLS/SSL, all servers (and some clients) must have a certificate.\nCertificates are public keys that correspond to a private key, and that are\ndigitally signed either by a Certificate Authority or by the owner of the\nprivate key (such certificates are referred to as &quot;self-signed&quot;). The first\nstep to obtaining a certificate is to create a Certificate Signing Request\n(CSR) file.\nThe OpenSSL command-line interface can be used to generate a CSR for a private\nkey:\nopenssl req -new -sha256 -key ryans-key.pem -out ryans-csr.pem\n\nOnce the CSR file is generated, it can either be sent to a Certificate\nAuthority for signing or used to generate a self-signed certificate.\nCreating a self-signed certificate using the OpenSSL command-line interface\nis illustrated in the example below:\nopenssl x509 -req -in ryans-csr.pem -signkey ryans-key.pem -out ryans-cert.pem\n\nOnce the certificate is generated, it can be used to generate a .pfx or\n.p12 file:\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -in ryans-cert.pem -inkey ryans-key.pem \\\n      -certfile ca-cert.pem -out ryans.pfx\n\nWhere:\n\nin: is the signed certificate\ninkey: is the associated private key\ncertfile: is a concatenation of all Certificate Authority (CA) certs into\n a single file, e.g. cat ca1-cert.pem ca2-cert.pem &gt; ca-cert.pem\n\nPerfect Forward Secrecy\n\nThe term &quot;Forward Secrecy&quot; or &quot;Perfect Forward Secrecy&quot; describes a feature of\nkey-agreement (i.e., key-exchange) methods. That is, the server and client keys\nare used to negotiate new temporary keys that are used specifically and only for\nthe current communication session. Practically, this means that even if the\nserver&#39;s private key is compromised, communication can only be decrypted by\neavesdroppers if the attacker manages to obtain the key-pair specifically\ngenerated for the session.\nPerfect Forward Secrecy is achieved by randomly generating a key pair for\nkey-agreement on every TLS/SSL handshake (in contrast to using the same key for\nall sessions). Methods implementing this technique are called &quot;ephemeral&quot;.\nCurrently two methods are commonly used to achieve Perfect Forward Secrecy (note\nthe character &quot;E&quot; appended to the traditional abbreviations):\n\nDHE - An ephemeral version of the Diffie Hellman key-agreement protocol.\nECDHE - An ephemeral version of the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman\nkey-agreement protocol.\n\nEphemeral methods may have some performance drawbacks, because key generation\nis expensive.\nTo use Perfect Forward Secrecy using DHE with the tls module, it is required\nto generate Diffie-Hellman parameters. The following illustrates the use of the\nOpenSSL command-line interface to generate such parameters:\nopenssl dhparam -outform PEM -out dhparam.pem 2048\n\nIf using Perfect Foward Secrecy using ECDHE, Diffie-Hellman parameters are\nnot required and a default ECDHE curve will be used. The ecdheCurve property\ncan be used when creating a TLS Server to specify the name of an\nalternative curve to use.\nALPN, NPN and SNI\n\nALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension), NPN (Next\nProtocol Negotiation) and, SNI (Server Name Indication) are TLS\nhandshake extensions:\n\nALPN/NPN - Allows the use of one TLS server for multiple protocols (HTTP,\nSPDY, HTTP/2)\nSNI - Allows the use of one TLS server for multiple hostnames with different\nSSL certificates.\n\nNote: Use of ALPN is recommended over NPN. The NPN extension has never been\nformally defined or documented and generally not recommended for use.\nClient-initiated renegotiation attack mitigation\n\nThe TLS protocol allows clients to renegotiate certain aspects of the TLS\nsession. Unfortunately, session renegotiation requires a disproportionate amount\nof server-side resources, making it a potential vector for denial-of-service\nattacks.\nTo mitigate the risk, renegotiation is limited to three times every ten minutes.\nAn &#39;error&#39; event is emitted on the tls.TLSSocket instance when this\nthreshold is exceeded. The limits are configurable:\n\ntls.CLIENT_RENEG_LIMIT {number} Specifies the number of renegotiation\nrequests. Defaults to 3.\ntls.CLIENT_RENEG_WINDOW {number} Specifies the time renegotiation window\nin seconds. Defaults to 600 (10 minutes).\n\nNote: The default renegotiation limits should not be modified without a full\nunderstanding of the implications and risks.\nTo test the renegotiation limits on a server, connect to it using the OpenSSL\ncommand-line client (openssl s_client -connect address:port) then input\nR&lt;CR&gt; (i.e., the letter R followed by a carriage return) multiple times.\nModifying the Default TLS Cipher suite\nNode.js is built with a default suite of enabled and disabled TLS ciphers.\nCurrently, the default cipher suite is:\nECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:\nECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:\nECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:\nECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:\nDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:\nECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:\nDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:\nECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:\nDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:\nECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:\nDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:\nHIGH:\n!aNULL:\n!eNULL:\n!EXPORT:\n!DES:\n!RC4:\n!MD5:\n!PSK:\n!SRP:\n!CAMELLIA\n\nThis default can be replaced entirely using the --tls-cipher-list command\nline switch. For instance, the following makes\nECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4 the default TLS cipher suite:\nnode --tls-cipher-list=&quot;ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4&quot;\n\nNote: The default cipher suite included within Node.js has been carefully\nselected to reflect current security best practices and risk mitigation.\nChanging the default cipher suite can have a significant impact on the security\nof an application. The --tls-cipher-list switch should by used only if\nabsolutely necessary.\nClass: tls.Server\n\nThe tls.Server class is a subclass of net.Server that accepts encrypted\nconnections using TLS or SSL.\nEvent: &#39;tlsClientError&#39;\n\nThe &#39;tlsClientError&#39; event is emitted when an error occurs before a secure\nconnection is established. The listener callback is passed two arguments when\ncalled:\n\nexception {Error} The Error object describing the error\ntlsSocket {tls.TLSSocket} The tls.TLSSocket instance from which the\nerror originated.\n\nEvent: &#39;newSession&#39;\n\nThe &#39;newSession&#39; event is emitted upon creation of a new TLS session. This may\nbe used to store sessions in external storage. The listener callback is passed\nthree arguments when called:\n\nsessionId - The TLS session identifier\nsessionData - The TLS session data\ncallback {Function} A callback function taking no arguments that must be\ninvoked in order for data to be sent or received over the secure connection.\n\nNote: Listening for this event will have an effect only on connections\nestablished after the addition of the event listener.\nEvent: &#39;OCSPRequest&#39;\n\nThe &#39;OCSPRequest&#39; event is emitted when the client sends a certificate status\nrequest. The listener callback is passed three arguments when called:\n\ncertificate {Buffer} The server certificate\nissuer {Buffer} The issuer&#39;s certificate\ncallback {Function} A callback function that must be invoked to provide\nthe results of the OCSP request.\n\nThe server&#39;s current certificate can be parsed to obtain the OCSP URL\nand certificate ID; after obtaining an OCSP response, callback(null, resp) is\nthen invoked, where resp is a Buffer instance containing the OCSP response.\nBoth certificate and issuer are Buffer DER-representations of the\nprimary and issuer&#39;s certificates. These can be used to obtain the OCSP\ncertificate ID and OCSP endpoint URL.\nAlternatively, callback(null, null) may be called, indicating that there was\nno OCSP response.\nCalling callback(err) will result in a socket.destroy(err) call.\nThe typical flow of an OCSP Request is as follows:\n\nClient connects to the server and sends an &#39;OCSPRequest&#39; (via the status\ninfo extension in ClientHello).\nServer receives the request and emits the &#39;OCSPRequest&#39; event, calling the\nlistener if registered.\nServer extracts the OCSP URL from either the certificate or issuer and\nperforms an OCSP request to the CA.\nServer receives OCSPResponse from the CA and sends it back to the client\nvia the callback argument\nClient validates the response and either destroys the socket or performs a\nhandshake.\n\nNote: The issuer can be null if the certificate is either self-signed or\nthe issuer is not in the root certificates list. (An issuer may be provided\nvia the ca option when establishing the TLS connection.)\nNote: Listening for this event will have an effect only on connections\nestablished after the addition of the event listener.\nNote: An npm module like asn1.js may be used to parse the certificates.\nEvent: &#39;resumeSession&#39;\n\nThe &#39;resumeSession&#39; event is emitted when the client requests to resume a\nprevious TLS session. The listener callback is passed two arguments when\ncalled:\n\nsessionId - The TLS/SSL session identifier\ncallback {Function} A callback function to be called when the prior session\nhas been recovered.\n\nWhen called, the event listener may perform a lookup in external storage using\nthe given sessionId and invoke callback(null, sessionData) once finished. If\nthe session cannot be resumed (i.e., doesn&#39;t exist in storage) the callback may\nbe invoked as callback(null, null). Calling callback(err) will terminate the\nincoming connection and destroy the socket.\nNote: Listening for this event will have an effect only on connections\nestablished after the addition of the event listener.\nThe following illustrates resuming a TLS session:\nconst tlsSessionStore = {};\nserver.on(&#39;newSession&#39;, (id, data, cb) =&gt; {\n  tlsSessionStore[id.toString(&#39;hex&#39;)] = data;\n  cb();\n});\nserver.on(&#39;resumeSession&#39;, (id, cb) =&gt; {\n  cb(null, tlsSessionStore[id.toString(&#39;hex&#39;)] || null);\n});\n\nEvent: &#39;secureConnection&#39;\n\nThe &#39;secureConnection&#39; event is emitted after the handshaking process for a\nnew connection has successfully completed. The listener callback is passed a\nsingle argument when called:\n\ntlsSocket {tls.TLSSocket} The established TLS socket.\n\nThe tlsSocket.authorized property is a boolean indicating whether the\nclient has been verified by one of the supplied Certificate Authorities for the\nserver. If tlsSocket.authorized is false, then socket.authorizationError\nis set to describe how authorization failed. Note that depending on the settings\nof the TLS server, unauthorized connections may still be accepted.\nThe tlsSocket.npnProtocol and tlsSocket.alpnProtocol properties are strings\nthat contain the selected NPN and ALPN protocols, respectively. When both NPN\nand ALPN extensions are received, ALPN takes precedence over NPN and the next\nprotocol is selected by ALPN.\nWhen ALPN has no selected protocol, tlsSocket.alpnProtocol returns false.\nThe tlsSocket.servername property is a string containing the server name\nrequested via SNI.\nserver.addContext(hostname, context)\n\n\nhostname {string} A SNI hostname or wildcard (e.g. &#39;*&#39;)\ncontext {Object} An object containing any of the possible properties\nfrom the tls.createSecureContext() options arguments (e.g. key,\ncert, ca, etc).\n\nThe server.addContext() method adds a secure context that will be used if\nthe client request&#39;s SNS hostname matches the supplied hostname (or wildcard).\nserver.address()\n\nReturns the bound address, the address family name, and port of the\nserver as reported by the operating system.  See net.Server.address() for\nmore information.\nserver.close([callback])\n\n\ncallback {Function} An optional listener callback that will be registered to\nlisten for the server instance&#39;s &#39;close&#39; event.\n\nThe server.close() method stops the server from accepting new connections.\nThis function operates asynchronously. The &#39;close&#39; event will be emitted\nwhen the the server is finally closed.\nserver.connections\n\nReturns the current number of concurrent connections on the server.\nserver.getTicketKeys()\n\nReturns a Buffer instance holding the keys currently used for\nencryption/decryption of the TLS Session Tickets\nserver.listen(port[, hostname][, callback])\n\n\nport {number} The TCP/IP port on which to begin listening for connections.\nA value of 0 (zero) will assign a random port.\nhostname {string} The hostname, IPv4, or IPv6 address on which to begin\nlistening for connections. If undefined, the server will accept connections\non any IPv6 address (::) when IPv6 is available, or any IPv4 address\n(0.0.0.0) otherwise.\ncallback {Function} A callback function to be invoked when the server has\nbegun listening the the port and hostname.\n\nThe server.listen() methods instructs the server to begin accepting\nconnections on the specified port and hostname.\nThis function operates asynchronously. If the callback is given, it will be\ncalled when the server has started listening.\nSee net.Server for more information.\nserver.setTicketKeys(keys)\n\n\nkeys {Buffer} The keys used for encryption/decryption of the\nTLS Session Tickets.\n\nUpdates the keys for encryption/decryption of the TLS Session Tickets.\nNote: The key&#39;s Buffer should be 48 bytes long. See ticketKeys option in\ntls.createServer for\nmore information on how it is used.\nNote: Changes to the ticket keys are effective only for future server\nconnections. Existing or currently pending server connections will use the\nprevious keys.\nClass: tls.TLSSocket\n\nThe tls.TLSSocket is a subclass of net.Socket that performs transparent\nencryption of written data and all required TLS negotiation.\nInstances of tls.TLSSocket implement the duplex Stream interface.\nNote: Methods that return TLS connection metadata (e.g.\ntls.TLSSocket.getPeerCertificate() will only return data while the\nconnection is open.\nnew tls.TLSSocket(socket[, options])\n\n\nsocket {net.Socket} An instance of net.Socket\noptions {Object}\nsecureContext: An optional TLS context object from\n tls.createSecureContext()\nisServer: If true the TLS socket will be instantiated in server-mode.\nDefaults to false.\nserver {net.Server} An optional net.Server instance.\nrequestCert: Optional, see tls.createServer()\nrejectUnauthorized: Optional, see tls.createServer()\nNPNProtocols: Optional, see tls.createServer()\nALPNProtocols: Optional, see tls.createServer()\nSNICallback: Optional, see tls.createServer()\nsession {Buffer} An optional Buffer instance containing a TLS session.\nrequestOCSP {boolean} If true, specifies that the OCSP status request\nextension will be added to the client hello and an &#39;OCSPResponse&#39; event\nwill be emitted on the socket before establishing a secure communication\n\n\n\nConstruct a new tls.TLSSocket object from an existing TCP socket.\nEvent: &#39;OCSPResponse&#39;\n\nThe &#39;OCSPResponse&#39; event is emitted if the requestOCSP option was set\nwhen the tls.TLSSocket was created and an OCSP response has been received.\nThe listener callback is passed a single argument when called:\n\nresponse {Buffer} The server&#39;s OCSP response\n\nTypically, the response is a digitally signed object from the server&#39;s CA that\ncontains information about server&#39;s certificate revocation status.\nEvent: &#39;secureConnect&#39;\n\nThe &#39;secureConnect&#39; event is emitted after the handshaking process for a new\nconnection has successfully completed. The listener callback will be called\nregardless of whether or not the server&#39;s certificate has been authorized. It\nis the client&#39;s responsibility to check the tlsSocket.authorized property to\ndetermine if the server certificate was signed by one of the specified CAs. If\ntlsSocket.authorized === false, then the error can be found by examining the\ntlsSocket.authorizationError property. If either ALPN or NPN was used,\nthe tlsSocket.alpnProtocol or tlsSocket.npnProtocol properties can be\nchecked to determine the negotiated protocol.\ntlsSocket.address()\n\nReturns the bound address, the address family name, and port of the\nunderlying socket as reported by the operating system. Returns an\nobject with three properties, e.g.,\n{ port: 12346, family: &#39;IPv4&#39;, address: &#39;127.0.0.1&#39; }\ntlsSocket.authorized\n\nReturns true if the peer certificate was signed by one of the CAs specified\nwhen creating the tls.TLSSocket instance, otherwise false.\ntlsSocket.authorizationError\n\nReturns the reason why the peer&#39;s certificate was not been verified.

This may be used to distinguish TLS sockets from regular\nnet.Socket instances.\ntlsSocket.getCipher()\n\nReturns an object representing the cipher name and the SSL/TLS protocol version\nthat first defined the cipher.\nFor example: { name: &#39;AES256-SHA&#39;, version: &#39;TLSv1/SSLv3&#39; }\nSee SSL_CIPHER_get_name() and SSL_CIPHER_get_version() in\nhttps://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/ssl/SSL_CIPHER_get_name.html for more\ninformation.\ntlsSocket.getEphemeralKeyInfo()\n\nReturns an object representing the type, name, and size of parameter of\nan ephemeral key exchange in Perfect Forward Secrecy on a client\nconnection. It returns an empty object when the key exchange is not\nephemeral. As this is only supported on a client socket; null is returned\nif called on a server socket. The supported types are &#39;DH&#39; and &#39;ECDH&#39;. The\nname property is available only when type is &#39;ECDH&#39;.\nFor Example: { type: &#39;ECDH&#39;, name: &#39;prime256v1&#39;, size: 256 }\ntlsSocket.getPeerCertificate([ detailed ])\n\n\ndetailed {boolean} Specify true to request that the full certificate\nchain with the issuer property be returned; false to return only the\ntop certificate without the issuer property.\n\nReturns an object representing the peer&#39;s certificate. The returned object has\nsome properties corresponding to the fields of the certificate.\nFor example:\n{ subject:\n   { C: &#39;UK&#39;,\n     ST: &#39;Acknack Ltd&#39;,\n     L: &#39;Rhys Jones&#39;,\n     O: &#39;node.js&#39;,\n     OU: &#39;Test TLS Certificate&#39;,\n     CN: &#39;localhost&#39; },\n  issuerInfo:\n   { C: &#39;UK&#39;,\n     ST: &#39;Acknack Ltd&#39;,\n     L: &#39;Rhys Jones&#39;,\n     O: &#39;node.js&#39;,\n     OU: &#39;Test TLS Certificate&#39;,\n     CN: &#39;localhost&#39; },\n  issuer:\n   { ... another certificate ... },\n  raw: &lt; RAW DER buffer &gt;,\n  valid_from: &#39;Nov 11 09:52:22 2009 GMT&#39;,\n  valid_to: &#39;Nov  6 09:52:22 2029 GMT&#39;,\n  fingerprint: &#39;2A:7A:C2:DD:E5:F9:CC:53:72:35:99:7A:02:5A:71:38:52:EC:8A:DF&#39;,\n  serialNumber: &#39;B9B0D332A1AA5635&#39; }\n\nIf the peer does not provide a certificate, null or an empty object will be\nreturned.\ntlsSocket.getProtocol()\n\nReturns a string containing the negotiated SSL/TLS protocol version of the\ncurrent connection. The value &#39;unknown&#39; will be returned for connected\nsockets that have not completed the handshaking process. The value null will\nbe returned for server sockets or disconnected client sockets.\nExample responses include:\n\nSSLv3\nTLSv1\nTLSv1.1\nTLSv1.2\nunknown\n\nSee https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/ssl/SSL_get_version.html for more\ninformation.\ntlsSocket.getSession()\n\nReturns the ASN.1 encoded TLS session or undefined if no session was\nnegotiated. Can be used to speed up handshake establishment when reconnecting\nto the server.\ntlsSocket.getTLSTicket()\n\nReturns the TLS session ticket or undefined if no session was negotiated.\nNote: This only works with client TLS sockets. Useful only for debugging, for\nsession reuse provide session option to tls.connect().\ntlsSocket.localAddress\n\nReturns the string representation of the local IP address.\ntlsSocket.localPort\n\nReturns the numeric representation of the local port.\ntlsSocket.remoteAddress\n\nReturns the string representation of the remote IP address.

Defaults to 16384. The\nmaximum value is 16384.\n\nThe tlsSocket.setMaxSendFragment() method sets the maximum TLS fragment size.\nReturns true if setting the limit succeeded; false otherwise.\nSmaller fragment sizes decrease the buffering latency on the client: larger\nfragments are buffered by the TLS layer until the entire fragment is received\nand its integrity is verified; large fragments can span multiple roundtrips\nand their processing can be delayed due to packet loss or reordering. However,\nsmaller fragments add extra TLS framing bytes and CPU overhead, which may\ndecrease overall server throughput.\ntls.connect(options[, callback])\n\n\noptions {Object}\nhost {string} Host the client should connect to.\nport {number} Port the client should connect to.\nsocket {net.Socket} Establish secure connection on a given socket rather\nthan creating a new socket.

Defaults to\ntrue.\nNPNProtocols {string[]|Buffer[]} An array of strings or Buffers\ncontaining supported NPN protocols. Buffers should have the format\n[len][name][len][name]... e.g. 0x05hello0x05world, where the first\nbyte is the length of the next protocol name. Passing an array is usually\nmuch simpler, e.g. [&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;].\nALPNProtocols: {string[]|Buffer[]} An array of strings or Buffers\ncontaining the supported ALPN protocols. Buffers should have the format\n[len][name][len][name]... e.g. 0x05hello0x05world, where the first byte\nis the length of the next protocol name.

Once binding is\ncomplete, a &#39;listening&#39; event is emitted and the optional callback function\nis called.\nNote that specifying both a &#39;listening&#39; event listener and passing a\ncallback to the socket.bind() method is not harmful but not very\nuseful.\nA bound datagram socket keeps the Node.js process running to receive\ndatagram messages.\nIf binding fails, an &#39;error&#39; event is generated.

If port is not specified, the\noperating system will attempt to bind to a random port. If address is not\nspecified, the operating system will attempt to listen on all addresses.  Once\nbinding is complete, a &#39;listening&#39; event is emitted and the optional\ncallback function is called.\nThe options object may contain an additional exclusive property that is\nuse when using dgram.Socket objects with the [cluster] module. When\nexclusive is set to false (the default), cluster workers will use the same\nunderlying socket handle allowing connection handling duties to be shared.\nWhen exclusive is true, however, the handle is not shared and attempted\nport sharing results in an error.\nAn example socket listening on an exclusive port is shown below.\nsocket.bind({\n  address: &#39;localhost&#39;,\n  port: 8000,\n  exclusive: true\n});\n\nsocket.close([callback])\nClose the underlying socket and stop listening for data on it.

This method is automatically called by the\nkernel when the socket is closed or the process terminates, so most apps will\nnever have reason to call this.\nIf multicastInterface is not specified, the operating system will attempt to\ndrop membership on all valid interfaces.\nsocket.send(msg, [offset, length,] port, address[, callback])\n\nmsg {Buffer|String|Array} Message to be sent\noffset {Number} Integer. Optional. Offset in the buffer where the message starts.\nlength {Number} Integer. Optional. Number of bytes in the message.\nport {Number} Integer. Destination port.\naddress {String} Destination hostname or IP address.\ncallback {Function} Called when the message has been sent. Optional.\n\nBroadcasts a datagram on the socket. The destination port and address must\nbe specified.\nThe msg argument contains the message to be sent.\nDepending on its type, different behavior can apply. If msg is a Buffer,\nthe offset and length specify the offset within the Buffer where the\nmessage begins and the number of bytes in the message, respectively.\nIf msg is a String, then it is automatically converted to a Buffer\nwith &#39;utf8&#39; encoding. With messages that\ncontain  multi-byte characters, offset and length will be calculated with\nrespect to byte length and not the character position.\nIf msg is an array, offset and length must not be specified.\nThe address argument is a string. If the value of address is a host name,\nDNS will be used to resolve the address of the host. If the address is not\nspecified or is an empty string, &#39;127.0.0.1&#39; or &#39;::1&#39; will be used instead.\nIf the socket has not been previously bound with a call to bind, the socket\nis assigned a random port number and is bound to the &quot;all interfaces&quot; address\n(&#39;0.0.0.0&#39; for udp4 sockets, &#39;::0&#39; for udp6 sockets.)\nAn optional callback function  may be specified to as a way of reporting\nDNS errors or for determining when it is safe to reuse the buf object.\nNote that DNS lookups delay the time to send for at least one tick of the\nNode.js event loop.\nThe only way to know for sure that the datagram has been sent is by using a\ncallback. If an error occurs and a callback is given, the error will be\npassed as the first argument to the callback. If a callback is not given,\nthe error is emitted as an &#39;error&#39; event on the socket object.\nOffset and length are optional, but if you specify one you would need to\nspecify the other. Also, they are supported only when the first\nargument is a Buffer.\nExample of sending a UDP packet to a random port on localhost;\nconst dgram = require(&#39;dgram&#39;);\nconst message = Buffer.from(&#39;Some bytes&#39;);\nconst client = dgram.createSocket(&#39;udp4&#39;);\nclient.send(message, 41234, &#39;localhost&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  client.close();\n});\n\nExample of sending a UDP packet composed of multiple buffers to a random port on localhost;\nconst dgram = require(&#39;dgram&#39;);\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from(&#39;Some &#39;);\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from(&#39;bytes&#39;);\nconst client = dgram.createSocket(&#39;udp4&#39;);\nclient.send([buf1, buf2], 41234, &#39;localhost&#39;, (err) =&gt; {\n  client.close();\n});\n\nSending multiple buffers might be faster or slower depending on your\napplication and operating system: benchmark it. Usually it is faster.\nA Note about UDP datagram size\nThe maximum size of an IPv4/v6 datagram depends on the MTU\n(Maximum Transmission Unit) and on the Payload Length field size.\n\nThe Payload Length field is 16 bits wide, which means that a normal\npayload exceed 64K octets including the internet header and data\n(65,507 bytes = 65,535 − 8 bytes UDP header − 20 bytes IP header);\nthis is generally true for loopback interfaces, but such long datagram\nmessages are impractical for most hosts and networks.\n\nThe MTU is the largest size a given link layer technology can support for\ndatagram messages. For any link, IPv4 mandates a minimum MTU of 68\noctets, while the recommended MTU for IPv4 is 576 (typically recommended\nas the MTU for dial-up type applications), whether they arrive whole or in\nfragments.\nFor IPv6, the minimum MTU is 1280 octets, however, the mandatory minimum\nfragment reassembly buffer size is 1500 octets. The value of 68 octets is\nvery small, since most current link layer technologies, like Ethernet, have a\nminimum MTU of 1500.\n\n\nIt is impossible to know in advance the MTU of each link through which\na packet might travel. Sending a datagram greater than the receiver MTU will\nnot work because the packet will get silently dropped without informing the\nsource that the data did not reach its intended recipient.\nsocket.setBroadcast(flag)\n\n\nflag {Boolean}\n\nSets or clears the SO_BROADCAST socket option.  When set to true, UDP\npackets may be sent to a local interface&#39;s broadcast address.\nsocket.setMulticastLoopback(flag)\n\nflag {Boolean}\n\nSets or clears the IP_MULTICAST_LOOP socket option.  When set to true,\nmulticast packets will also be received on the local interface.\nsocket.setMulticastTTL(ttl)\n\nttl {Number} Integer\n\nSets the IP_MULTICAST_TTL socket option.  While TTL generally stands for\n&quot;Time to Live&quot;, in this context it specifies the number of IP hops that a\npacket is allowed to travel through, specifically for multicast traffic.  Each\nrouter or gateway that forwards a packet decrements the TTL. If the TTL is\ndecremented to 0 by a router, it will not be forwarded.\nThe argument passed to to socket.setMulticastTTL() is a number of hops\nbetween 0 and 255. The default on most systems is 1 but can vary.\nsocket.setTTL(ttl)\n\nttl {Number} Integer\n\nSets the IP_TTL socket option. While TTL generally stands for &quot;Time to Live&quot;,\nin this context it specifies the number of IP hops that a packet is allowed to\ntravel through.  Each router or gateway that forwards a packet decrements the\nTTL.  If the TTL is decremented to 0 by a router, it will not be forwarded.\nChanging TTL values is typically done for network probes or when multicasting.\nThe argument to socket.setTTL() is a number of hops between 1 and 255.\nThe default on most systems is 64 but can vary.\nsocket.ref()\nBy default, binding a socket will cause it to block the Node.js process from\nexiting as long as the socket is open. The socket.unref() method can be used\nto exclude the socket from the reference counting that keeps the Node.js\nprocess active. The socket.ref() method adds the socket back to the reference\ncounting and restores the default behavior.\nCalling socket.ref() multiples times will have no additional effect.\nThe socket.ref() method returns a reference to the socket so calls can be\nchained.\nsocket.unref()\nBy default, binding a socket will cause it to block the Node.js process from\nexiting as long as the socket is open. The socket.unref() method can be used\nto exclude the socket from the reference counting that keeps the Node.js\nprocess active, allowing the process to exit even if the socket is still\nlistening.\nCalling socket.unref() multiple times will have no addition effect.\nThe socket.unref() method returns a reference to the socket so calls can be\nchained.\nChange to asynchronous socket.bind() behavior\nAs of Node.js v0.10, dgram.Socket#bind() changed to an asynchronous\nexecution model.

This string subset follows the protocol and\ndouble slashes (if present) and preceeds the host component, delimited by an\nASCII &quot;at sign&quot; (@). The format of the string is {username}[:{password}],\nwith the [:{password}] portion being optional.\nFor example: &#39;user:pass&#39;\nurlObject.hostname\nThe hostname property is the lower-cased host name portion of the host\ncomponent without the port included.\nFor example: &#39;host.com&#39;\nurlObject.port\nThe port property is the numeric port portion of the host component.\nFor example: &#39;8080&#39;\nurlObject.pathname\nThe pathname property consists of the entire path section of the URL. This\nis everything following the host (including the port) and before the start\nof the query or hash components, delimited by either the ASCII question\nmark (?) or hash (#) characters.\nFor example &#39;/p/a/t/h&#39;\nNo decoding of the path string is performed.\nurlObject.search\nThe search property consists of the entire &quot;query string&quot; portion of the\nURL, including the leading ASCII question mark (?) character.\nFor example: &#39;?query=string&#39;\nNo decoding of the query string is performed.\nurlObject.path\nThe path property is a concatenation of the pathname and search\ncomponents.\nFor example: &#39;/p/a/t/h?query=string&#39;\nNo decoding of the path is performed.\nurlObject.query\nThe query property is either the &quot;params&quot; portion of the query string (\neverything except the leading ASCII question mark (?), or an object\nreturned by the querystring module&#39;s parse() method:\nFor example: &#39;query=string&#39; or {&#39;query&#39;: &#39;string&#39;}\nIf returned as a string, no decoding of the query string is performed. If\nreturned as an object, both keys and values are decoded.\nurlObject.hash\nThe hash property consists of the &quot;fragment&quot; portion of the URL including\nthe leading ASCII hash (#) character.\nFor example: &#39;#hash&#39;\nurl.format(urlObject)\n\n\nurlObject {Object | String} A URL object (as returned by url.parse() or\nconstructed otherwise). If a string, it is converted to an object by passing\nit to url.parse().\n\nThe url.format() method returns a formatted URL string derived from\nurlObject.\nIf urlObject is not an object or a string, url.parse() will throw a\nTypeError.\nThe formatting process operates as follows:\n\nA new empty string result is created.\nIf urlObject.protocol is a string, it is appended as-is to result.\nOtherwise, if urlObject.protocol is not undefined and is not a string, an\nError is thrown.\nFor all string values of urlObject.protocol that do not end with an ASCII\ncolon (:) character, the literal string : will be appended to result.\nIf either the urlObject.slashes property is true, urlObject.protocol\nbegins with one of http, https, ftp, gopher, or file, or\nurlObject.protocol is undefined, the literal string // will be appended\nto result.\nIf the value of the urlObject.auth property is truthy, and either\nurlObject.host or urlObject.hostname are not undefined, the value of\nurlObject.auth will be coerced into a string and appended to result\n followed by the literal string @.\nIf the urlObject.host property is undefined then:\nIf the urlObject.hostname is a string, it is appended to result.\nOtherwise, if urlObject.hostname is not undefined and is not a string,\nan Error is thrown.\nIf the urlObject.port property value is truthy, and urlObject.hostname\nis not undefined:\nThe literal string : is appended to result, and\nThe value of urlObject.port is coerced to a string and appended to\nresult.\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, if the urlObject.host property value is truthy, the value of\nurlObject.host is coerced to a string and appended to result.\nIf the urlObject.pathname property is a string that is not an empty string:\nIf the urlObject.pathname does not start with an ASCII forward slash\n(/), then the literal string &#39;/&#39; is appended to result.\nThe value of urlObject.pathname is appended to result.\n\n\nOtherwise, if urlObject.pathname is not undefined and is not a string, an\nError is thrown.\nIf the urlObject.search property is undefined and if the urlObject.query\nproperty is an Object, the literal string ? is appended to result\nfollowed by the output of calling the querystring module&#39;s stringify()\nmethod passing the value of urlObject.query.\nOtherwise, if urlObject.search is a string:\nIf the value of urlObject.search does not start with the ASCII question\nmark (?) character, the literal string ? is appended to result.\nThe value of urlObject.search is appended to result.\n\n\nOtherwise, if urlObject.search is not undefined and is not a string, an\nError is thrown.\nIf the urlObject.hash property is a string:\nIf the value of urlObject.hash does not start with the ASCII hash (#)\ncharacter, the literal string # is appended to result.\nThe value of urlObject.hash is appended to result.\n\n\nOtherwise, if the urlObject.hash property is not undefined and is not a\nstring, an Error is thrown.\nresult is returned.\n\nurl.parse(urlString[, parseQueryString[, slashesDenoteHost]])\n\n\nurlString {string} The URL string to parse.\nparseQueryString {boolean} If true, the query property will always\nbe set to an object returned by the querystring module&#39;s parse()\nmethod. If false, the query property on the returned URL object will be an\nunparsed, undecoded string. Defaults to false.\nslashesDenoteHost {boolean} If true, the first token after the literal\nstring // and preceeding the next / will be interpreted as the host.\nFor instance, given //foo/bar, the result would be\n{host: &#39;foo&#39;, pathname: &#39;/bar&#39;} rather than {pathname: &#39;//foo/bar&#39;}.\nDefaults to false.\n\nThe url.parse() method takes a URL string, parses it, and returns a URL\nobject.\nurl.resolve(from, to)\n\n\nfrom {string} The Base URL being resolved against.\nto {string} The HREF URL being resolved.\n\nThe url.resolve() method resolves a target URL relative to a base URL in a\nmanner similar to that of a Web browser resolving an anchor tag HREF.\nFor example:\nurl.resolve(&#39;/one/two/three&#39;, &#39;four&#39;)         // &#39;/one/two/four&#39;\nurl.resolve(&#39;http://example.com/&#39;, &#39;/one&#39;)    // &#39;http://example.com/one&#39;\nurl.resolve(&#39;http://example.com/one&#39;, &#39;/two&#39;) // &#39;http://example.com/two&#39;\n\nEscaped Characters\nURLs are only permitted to contain a certain range of characters. Spaces (&#39; &#39;)\nand the following characters will be automatically escaped in the\nproperties of URL objects:\n&lt; &gt; &quot; ` \\r \\n \\t { } | \\ ^ &#39;\n\nFor example, the ASCII space character (&#39; &#39;) is encoded as %20. The ASCII\nforward slash (/) character is encoded as %3C.\n"},"util.html":{"url":"util.html","title":"Utilities","body":"title: util\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nutil\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe util module is primarily designed to support the needs of Node.js&#39; own\ninternal APIs. However, many of the utilities are useful for application and\nmodule developers as well. It can be accessed using:\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nutil.debuglog(section)\n\nsection {String} A string identifying the portion of the application for\nwhich the debuglog function is being created.\nReturns: {Function} The logging function\n\nThe util.debuglog() method is used to create a function that conditionally\nwrites debug messages to stderr based on the existence of the NODE_DEBUG\nenvironment variable.  If the section name appears within the value of that\nenvironment variable, then the returned function operates similar to\nconsole.error().  If not, then the returned function is a no-op.\nFor example:\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\nconst debuglog = util.debuglog(&#39;foo&#39;);\n\ndebuglog(&#39;hello from foo [%d]&#39;, 123);\n\nIf this program is run with NODE_DEBUG=foo in the environment, then\nit will output something like:\nFOO 3245: hello from foo [123]\n\nwhere 3245 is the process id.  If it is not run with that\nenvironment variable set, then it will not print anything.\nMultiple comma-separated section names may be specified in the NODE_DEBUG\nenvironment variable. For example: NODE_DEBUG=fs,net,tls.\nutil.deprecate(function, string)\nThe util.deprecate() method wraps the given function in such a way that\nit is marked as deprecated.\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nexports.puts = util.deprecate(function() {\n  for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i &lt; len; ++i) {\n    process.stdout.write(arguments[i] + &#39;\\n&#39;);\n  }\n}, &#39;util.puts: Use console.log instead&#39;);\n\nWhen called, util.deprecate() will return a function that will emit a\nDeprecationWarning using the process.on(&#39;warning&#39;) event. By default,\nthis warning will be emitted and printed to stderr exactly once, the first\ntime it is called. After the warning is emitted, the wrapped function\nis called.\nIf either the --no-deprecation or --no-warnings command line flags are\nused, or if the process.noDeprecation property is set to true prior to\nthe first deprecation warning, the util.deprecate() method does nothing.\nIf the --trace-deprecation or --trace-warnings command line flags are set,\nor the process.traceDeprecation property is set to true, a warning and a\nstack trace are printed to stderr the first time the deprecated function is\ncalled.\nIf the --throw-deprecation command line flag is set, or the\nprocess.throwDeprecation property is set to true, then an exception will be\nthrown when the deprecated function is called.\nThe --throw-deprecation command line flag and process.throwDeprecation\nproperty take precedence over --trace-deprecation and\nprocess.traceDeprecation.\nutil.format(format[, ...])\n\nformat {string} A printf-like format string.\n\nThe util.format() method returns a formatted string using the first argument\nas a printf-like format.\nThe first argument is a string containing zero or more placeholder tokens.\nEach placeholder token is replaced with the converted value from the\ncorresponding argument. Supported placeholders are:\n\n%s - String.\n%d - Number (both integer and float).\n%j - JSON.  Replaced with the string &#39;[Circular]&#39; if the argument\ncontains circular references.\n%% - single percent sign (&#39;%&#39;). This does not consume an argument.\n\nIf the placeholder does not have a corresponding argument, the placeholder is\nnot replaced.\nutil.format(&#39;%s:%s&#39;, &#39;foo&#39;);\n  // Returns &#39;foo:%s&#39;\n\nIf there are more arguments passed to the util.format() method than the\nnumber of placeholders, the extra arguments are coerced into strings (for\nobjects and symbols, util.inspect() is used) then concatenated to the\nreturned string, each delimited by a space.\nutil.format(&#39;%s:%s&#39;, &#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;baz&#39;); // &#39;foo:bar baz&#39;\n\nIf the first argument is not a format string then util.format() returns\na string that is the concatenation of all arguments separated by spaces.\nEach argument is converted to a string using util.inspect().\nutil.format(1, 2, 3); // &#39;1 2 3&#39;\n\nutil.inherits(constructor, superConstructor)\nNote: usage of util.inherits() is discouraged. Please use the ES6 class and\nextends keywords to get language level inheritance support. Also note that\nthe two styles are semantically incompatible.\n\nconstructor {Function}\nsuperConstructor {Function}\n\nInherit the prototype methods from one constructor into another.  The\nprototype of constructor will be set to a new object created from\nsuperConstructor.\nAs an additional convenience, superConstructor will be accessible\nthrough the constructor.super_ property.\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\nconst EventEmitter = require(&#39;events&#39;);\n\nfunction MyStream() {\n  EventEmitter.call(this);\n}\n\nutil.inherits(MyStream, EventEmitter);\n\nMyStream.prototype.write = function(data) {\n  this.emit(&#39;data&#39;, data);\n};\n\nconst stream = new MyStream();\n\nconsole.log(stream instanceof EventEmitter); // true\nconsole.log(MyStream.super_ === EventEmitter); // true\n\nstream.on(&#39;data&#39;, (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Received data: &quot;${data}&quot;`);\n});\nstream.write(&#39;It works!&#39;); // Received data: &quot;It works!&quot;\n\nutil.inspect(object[, options])\n\nobject {any} Any JavaScript primitive or Object.\noptions {Object}\nshowHidden {boolean} If true, the object&#39;s non-enumerable symbols and\nproperties will be included in the formatted result. Defaults to false.\ndepth {number} Specifies the number of times to recurse while formatting\nthe object. This is useful for inspecting large complicated objects.\nDefaults to 2. To make it recurse indefinitely pass null.\ncolors {boolean} If true, the output will be styled with ANSI color\ncodes. Defaults to false. Colors are customizable, see\nCustomizing util.inspect colors.\ncustomInspect {boolean} If false, then custom inspect(depth, opts)\nfunctions exported on the object being inspected will not be called.\nDefaults to true.\nshowProxy {boolean} If true, then objects and functions that are\nProxy objects will be introspected to show their target and handler\nobjects. Defaults to false.\nmaxArrayLength {number} Specifies the maximum number of array and\nTypedArray elements to include when formatting. Defaults to 100. Set to\nnull to show all array elements. Set to 0 or negative to show no array\nelements.\nbreakLength {number} The length at which an object&#39;s keys are split\nacross multiple lines. Set to Infinity to format an object as a single\nline. Defaults to 60 for legacy compatibility.\n\n\n\nThe util.inspect() method returns a string representation of object that is\nprimarily useful for debugging. Additional options may be passed that alter\ncertain aspects of the formatted string.\nThe following example inspects all properties of the util object:\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nconsole.log(util.inspect(util, { showHidden: true, depth: null }));\n\nValues may supply their own custom inspect(depth, opts) functions, when\ncalled these receive the current depth in the recursive inspection, as well as\nthe options object passed to util.inspect().\nCustomizing util.inspect colors\n\nColor output (if enabled) of util.inspect is customizable globally\nvia the util.inspect.styles and util.inspect.colors properties.\nutil.inspect.styles is a map associating a style name to a color from\nutil.inspect.colors.\nThe default styles and associated colors are:\n\nnumber - yellow\nboolean - yellow\nstring - green\ndate - magenta\nregexp - red\nnull - bold\nundefined - grey\nspecial - cyan (only applied to functions at this time)\nname - (no styling)\n\nThe predefined color codes are: white, grey, black, blue, cyan,\ngreen, magenta, red and yellow. There are also bold, italic,\nunderline and inverse codes.\nColor styling uses ANSI control codes that may not be supported on all\nterminals.\nCustom inspect() function on Objects\n\nObjects may also define their own inspect(depth, opts) function that\nutil.inspect() will invoke and use the result of when inspecting the object:\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nconst obj = { name: &#39;nate&#39; };\nobj.inspect = function(depth) {\n  return `{${this.name}}`;\n};\n\nutil.inspect(obj);\n  // &quot;{nate}&quot;\n\nCustom inspect(depth, opts) functions typically return a string but may\nreturn a value of any type that will be formatted accordingly by\nutil.inspect().\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\n\nconst obj = { foo: &#39;this will not show up in the inspect() output&#39; };\nobj.inspect = function(depth) {\n  return { bar: &#39;baz&#39; };\n};\n\nutil.inspect(obj);\n  // &quot;{ bar: &#39;baz&#39; }&quot;\n\nDeprecated APIs\nThe following APIs have been deprecated and should no longer be used.

The\ncompiled vm.Script can be run later multiple times. It is important to note\nthat the code is not bound to any global object; rather, it is bound before\neach run, just for that run.\nscript.runInContext(contextifiedSandbox[, options])\n\n\ncontextifiedSandbox {Object} A contextified object as returned by the\nvm.createContext() method.\noptions {Object}\nfilename {string} Specifies the filename used in stack traces produced\nby this script.\nlineOffset {number} Specifies the line number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ncolumnOffset {number} Specifies the column number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ndisplayErrors {boolean} When true, if an Error error occurs\nwhile compiling the code, the line of code causing the error is attached\nto the stack trace.\ntimeout {number} Specifies the number of milliseconds to execute code\nbefore terminating execution.

The globals are set on and\ncontained within each individual sandbox.\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\nconst vm = require(&#39;vm&#39;);\n\nconst script = new vm.Script(&#39;globalVar = &quot;set&quot;&#39;);\n\nconst sandboxes = [{}, {}, {}];\nsandboxes.forEach((sandbox) =&gt; {\n  script.runInNewContext(sandbox);\n});\n\nconsole.log(util.inspect(sandboxes));\n\n// [{ globalVar: &#39;set&#39; }, { globalVar: &#39;set&#39; }, { globalVar: &#39;set&#39; }]\n\nscript.runInThisContext([options])\n\n\noptions {Object}\nfilename {string} Specifies the filename used in stack traces produced\nby this script.\nlineOffset {number} Specifies the line number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ncolumnOffset {number} Specifies the column number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ndisplayErrors {boolean} When true, if an Error error occurs\nwhile compiling the code, the line of code causing the error is attached\nto the stack trace.\ntimeout {number} Specifies the number of milliseconds to execute code\nbefore terminating execution.

Running code does not have access to local scope, but\ndoes have access to the current global object.\nThe following example compiles code that increments a global variable then\nexecutes that code multiple times:\nconst vm = require(&#39;vm&#39;);\n\nglobal.globalVar = 0;\n\nconst script = new vm.Script(&#39;globalVar += 1&#39;, { filename: &#39;myfile.vm&#39; });\n\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {\n  script.runInThisContext();\n}\n\nconsole.log(globalVar);\n\n// 1000\n\nvm.createContext([sandbox])\n\n\nsandbox {Object}\n\nIf given a sandbox object, the vm.createContext() method will prepare\nthat sandbox so that it can be used in calls to\nvm.runInContext() or script.runInContext(). Inside such scripts,\nthe sandbox object will be the global object, retaining all of its existing\nproperties but also having the built-in objects and functions any standard\nglobal object has. Outside of scripts run by the vm module, sandbox will\nremain unchanged.\nIf sandbox is omitted (or passed explicitly as undefined), a new, empty\ncontextified sandbox object will be returned.\nThe vm.createContext() method is primarily useful for creating a single\nsandbox that can be used to run multiple scripts. For instance, if emulating a\nweb browser, the method can be used to create a single sandbox representing a\nwindow&#39;s global object, then run all &lt;script&gt; tags together within the context\nof that sandbox.\nvm.isContext(sandbox)\n\n\nsandbox {Object}\n\nReturns true if the given sandbox object has been contextified using\nvm.createContext().\nvm.runInContext(code, contextifiedSandbox[, options])\n\ncode {string} The JavaScript code to compile and run.\ncontextifiedSandbox {Object} The contextified object that will be used\nas the global when the code is compiled and run.\noptions\nfilename {string} Specifies the filename used in stack traces produced\nby this script.\nlineOffset {number} Specifies the line number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ncolumnOffset {number} Specifies the column number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ndisplayErrors {boolean} When true, if an Error error occurs\nwhile compiling the code, the line of code causing the error is attached\nto the stack trace.\ntimeout {number} Specifies the number of milliseconds to execute code\nbefore terminating execution. If execution is terminated, an Error\nwill be thrown.\n\n\n\nThe vm.runInContext() method compiles code, runs it within the context of\nthe contextifiedSandbox, then returns the result. Running code does not have\naccess to the local scope. The contextifiedSandbox object must have been\npreviously contextified using the vm.createContext() method.\nThe following example compiles and executes different scripts using a single\ncontextified object:\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\nconst vm = require(&#39;vm&#39;);\n\nconst sandbox = { globalVar: 1 };\nvm.createContext(sandbox);\n\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {\n  vm.runInContext(&#39;globalVar *= 2;&#39;, sandbox);\n}\nconsole.log(util.inspect(sandbox));\n\n// { globalVar: 1024 }\n\nvm.runInDebugContext(code)\n\n\ncode {string} The JavaScript code to compile and run.\n\nThe vm.runInDebugContext() method compiles and executes code inside the V8\ndebug context. The primary use case is to gain access to the V8 Debug object:\nconst vm = require(&#39;vm&#39;);\nconst Debug = vm.runInDebugContext(&#39;Debug&#39;);\nconsole.log(Debug.findScript(process.emit).name);  // &#39;events.js&#39;\nconsole.log(Debug.findScript(process.exit).name);  // &#39;internal/process.js&#39;\n\nNote: The debug context and object are intrinsically tied to V8&#39;s debugger\nimplementation and may change (or even be removed) without prior warning.\nThe Debug object can also be made available using the V8-specific\n--expose_debug_as= [command line option][cli.md].\nvm.runInNewContext(code[, sandbox][, options])\n\n\ncode {string} The JavaScript code to compile and run.\nsandbox {Object} An object that will be contextified. If undefined, a\nnew object will be created.\noptions\nfilename {string} Specifies the filename used in stack traces produced\nby this script.\nlineOffset {number} Specifies the line number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ncolumnOffset {number} Specifies the column number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ndisplayErrors {boolean} When true, if an Error error occurs\nwhile compiling the code, the line of code causing the error is attached\nto the stack trace.\ntimeout {number} Specifies the number of milliseconds to execute code\nbefore terminating execution. If execution is terminated, an Error\nwill be thrown.\n\n\n\nThe vm.runInContext() first contextifies the given sandbox object (or\ncreates a new sandbox if passed as undefined), compiles the code, runs it\nwithin the context of the created context, then returns the result. Running code\ndoes not have access to the local scope.\nThe following example compiles and executes code that increments a global\nvariable and sets a new one. These globals are contained in the sandbox.\nconst util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\nconst vm = require(&#39;vm&#39;);\n\nconst sandbox = {\n  animal: &#39;cat&#39;,\n  count: 2\n};\n\nvm.runInNewContext(&#39;count += 1; name = &quot;kitty&quot;&#39;, sandbox);\nconsole.log(util.inspect(sandbox));\n\n// { animal: &#39;cat&#39;, count: 3, name: &#39;kitty&#39; }\n\nvm.runInThisContext(code[, options])\n\n\ncode {string} The JavaScript code to compile and run.\noptions\nfilename {string} Specifies the filename used in stack traces produced\nby this script.\nlineOffset {number} Specifies the line number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ncolumnOffset {number} Specifies the column number offset that is displayed\nin stack traces produced by this script.\ndisplayErrors {boolean} When true, if an Error error occurs\nwhile compiling the code, the line of code causing the error is attached\nto the stack trace.\ntimeout {number} Specifies the number of milliseconds to execute code\nbefore terminating execution. If execution is terminated, an Error\nwill be thrown.\n\n\n\nvm.runInThisContext() compiles code, runs it within the context of the\ncurrent global and returns the result. Running code does not have access to\nlocal scope, but does have access to the current global object.\nThe following example illustrates using both vm.runInThisContext() and\nthe JavaScript eval() function to run the same code:\nconst vm = require(&#39;vm&#39;);\nvar localVar = &#39;initial value&#39;;\n\nconst vmResult = vm.runInThisContext(&#39;localVar = &quot;vm&quot;;&#39;);\nconsole.log(&#39;vmResult:&#39;, vmResult);\nconsole.log(&#39;localVar:&#39;, localVar);\n\nconst evalResult = eval(&#39;localVar = &quot;eval&quot;;&#39;);\nconsole.log(&#39;evalResult:&#39;, evalResult);\nconsole.log(&#39;localVar:&#39;, localVar);\n\n// vmResult: &#39;vm&#39;, localVar: &#39;initial value&#39;\n// evalResult: &#39;eval&#39;, localVar: &#39;eval&#39;\n\nBecause vm.runInThisContext() does not have access to the local scope,\nlocalVar is unchanged. In contrast, eval() does have access to the\nlocal scope, so the value localVar is changed. In this way\nvm.runInThisContext() is much like an indirect eval() call, e.g.\n(0,eval)(&#39;code&#39;).\nExample: Running an HTTP Server within a VM\nWhen using either script.runInThisContext() or vm.runInThisContext(), the\ncode is executed within the current V8 global context. The code passed\nto this VM context will have its own isolated scope.\nIn order to run a simple web server using the http module the code passed to\nthe context must either call require(&#39;http&#39;) on its own, or have a reference\nto the http module passed to it. For instance:\n&#39;use strict&#39;;\nconst vm = require(&#39;vm&#39;);\n\nlet code =\n`(function(require) {\n\n   const http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\n\n   http.createServer( (request, response) =&gt; {\n     response.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;});\n     response.end(&#39;Hello World\\\\n&#39;);\n   }).listen(8124);\n\n   console.log(&#39;Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/&#39;);\n })`;\n\n vm.runInThisContext(code)(require);\n\nNote: The require() in the above case shares the state with context it is\npassed from. This may introduce risks when untrusted code is executed, e.g.\naltering objects from the calling thread&#39;s context in unwanted ways.\nWhat does it mean to &quot;contextify&quot; an object?\nAll JavaScript executed within Node.js runs within the scope of a &quot;context&quot;.\nAccording to the V8 Embedder&#39;s Guide:\n\nIn V8, a context is an execution environment that allows separate, unrelated,\nJavaScript applications to run in a single instance of V8. You must explicitly\nspecify the context in which you want any JavaScript code to be run.\n\nWhen the method vm.createContext() is called, the sandbox object that is\npassed in (or a newly created object if sandbox is undefined) is associated\ninternally with a new instance of a V8 Context. This V8 Context provides the\ncode run using the vm modules methods with an isolated global environment\nwithin which it can operate. The process of creating the V8 Context and\nassociating it with the sandbox object is what this document refers to as\n&quot;contextifying&quot; the sandbox.\n"},"zlib.html":{"url":"zlib.html","title":"ZLIB","body":"title: zlib\ntags: node\ndate: 2016-08-11 10:27:51\nZlib\nStability: 2 - Stable\nThe zlib module provides compression functionality implemented using Gzip and\nDeflate/Inflate. It can be accessed using:\nconst zlib = require(&#39;zlib&#39;);\n\nCompressing or decompressing a stream (such as a file) can be accomplished by \npiping the source stream data through a zlib stream into a destination stream:\nconst gzip = zlib.createGzip();\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nconst inp = fs.createReadStream(&#39;input.txt&#39;);\nconst out = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;input.txt.gz&#39;);\n\ninp.pipe(gzip).pipe(out);\n\nIt is also possible to compress or decompress data in a single step:\nconst input = &#39;.................................&#39;;\nzlib.deflate(input, (err, buffer) =&gt; {\n  if (!err) {\n    console.log(buffer.toString(&#39;base64&#39;));\n  } else {\n    // handle error\n  }\n});\n\nconst buffer = Buffer.from(&#39;eJzT0yMAAGTvBe8=&#39;, &#39;base64&#39;);\nzlib.unzip(buffer, (err, buffer) =&gt; {\n  if (!err) {\n    console.log(buffer.toString());\n  } else {\n    // handle error\n  }\n});\n\nCompressing HTTP requests and responses\nThe zlib module can be used to implement support for the gzip and deflate\ncontent-encoding mechanisms defined by \nHTTP.\nThe HTTP Accept-Encoding header is used within an http request to identify\nthe compression encodings accepted by the client. The Content-Encoding \nheader is used to identify the compression encodings actually applied to a \nmessage.\nNote: the examples given below are drastically simplified to show\nthe basic concept.  Using zlib encoding can be expensive, and the results\nought to be cached.  See Memory Usage Tuning for more information\non the speed/memory/compression tradeoffs involved in zlib usage.\n// client request example\nconst zlib = require(&#39;zlib&#39;);\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nconst request = http.get({ host: &#39;example.com&#39;,\n                         path: &#39;/&#39;,\n                         port: 80,\n                         headers: { &#39;Accept-Encoding&#39;: &#39;gzip,deflate&#39; } });\nrequest.on(&#39;response&#39;, (response) =&gt; {\n  var output = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;example.com_index.html&#39;);\n\n  switch (response.headers[&#39;content-encoding&#39;]) {\n    // or, just use zlib.createUnzip() to handle both cases\n    case &#39;gzip&#39;:\n      response.pipe(zlib.createGunzip()).pipe(output);\n      break;\n    case &#39;deflate&#39;:\n      response.pipe(zlib.createInflate()).pipe(output);\n      break;\n    default:\n      response.pipe(output);\n      break;\n  }\n});\n\n// server example\n// Running a gzip operation on every request is quite expensive.\n// It would be much more efficient to cache the compressed buffer.\nconst zlib = require(&#39;zlib&#39;);\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\nhttp.createServer((request, response) =&gt; {\n  var raw = fs.createReadStream(&#39;index.html&#39;);\n  var acceptEncoding = request.headers[&#39;accept-encoding&#39;];\n  if (!acceptEncoding) {\n    acceptEncoding = &#39;&#39;;\n  }\n\n  // Note: this is not a conformant accept-encoding parser.\n  // See http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.3\n  if (acceptEncoding.match(/\\bdeflate\\b/)) {\n    response.writeHead(200, { &#39;Content-Encoding&#39;: &#39;deflate&#39; });\n    raw.pipe(zlib.createDeflate()).pipe(response);\n  } else if (acceptEncoding.match(/\\bgzip\\b/)) {\n    response.writeHead(200, { &#39;Content-Encoding&#39;: &#39;gzip&#39; });\n    raw.pipe(zlib.createGzip()).pipe(response);\n  } else {\n    response.writeHead(200, {});\n    raw.pipe(response);\n  }\n}).listen(1337);\n\nBy default, the zlib methods with throw an error when decompressing\ntruncated data. However, if it is known that the data is incomplete, or\nthe desire is to inspect only the beginning of a compressed file, it is\npossible to suppress the default error handling by changing the flushing\nmethod that is used to compressed the last chunk of input data:\n// This is a truncated version of the buffer from the above examples\nconst buffer = Buffer.from(&#39;eJzT0yMA&#39;, &#39;base64&#39;);\n\nzlib.unzip(buffer,\n           {finishFlush: zlib.constants.Z_SYNC_FLUSH},\n           (err, buffer) =&gt; {\n  if (!err) {\n    console.log(buffer.toString());\n  } else {\n    // handle error\n  }\n});\n\nThis will not change the behavior in other error-throwing situations, e.g.\nwhen the input data has an invalid format. Using this method, it will not be\npossible to determine whether the input ended prematurely or lacks the\nintegrity checks, making it necessary to manually check that the\ndecompressed result is valid.\nMemory Usage Tuning\n\nFrom zlib/zconf.h, modified to node.js&#39;s usage:\nThe memory requirements for deflate are (in bytes):\n(1 &lt;&lt; (windowBits+2)) +  (1 &lt;&lt; (memLevel+9))\n\nThat is: 128K for windowBits=15  +  128K for memLevel = 8\n(default values) plus a few kilobytes for small objects.\nFor example, to reduce the default memory requirements from 256K to 128K, the\noptions shoud be set to:\n{ windowBits: 14, memLevel: 7 }\n\nThis will, however, generally degrade compression.\nThe memory requirements for inflate are (in bytes)\n1 &lt;&lt; windowBits\n\nThat is, 32K for windowBits=15 (default value) plus a few kilobytes\nfor small objects.\nThis is in addition to a single internal output slab buffer of size\nchunkSize, which defaults to 16K.\nThe speed of zlib compression is affected most dramatically by the\nlevel setting.  A higher level will result in better compression, but\nwill take longer to complete.  A lower level will result in less\ncompression, but will be much faster.\nIn general, greater memory usage options will mean that Node.js has to make\nfewer calls to zlib because it will be able to process more data on\neach write operation.  So, this is another factor that affects the\nspeed, at the cost of memory usage.\nFlushing\nCalling .flush() on a compression stream will make zlib return as much\noutput as currently possible. This may come at the cost of degraded compression\nquality, but can be useful when data needs to be available as soon as possible.\nIn the following example, flush() is used to write a compressed partial\nHTTP response to the client:\nconst zlib = require(&#39;zlib&#39;);\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\n\nhttp.createServer((request, response) =&gt; {\n  // For the sake of simplicity, the Accept-Encoding checks are omitted.\n  response.writeHead(200, { &#39;content-encoding&#39;: &#39;gzip&#39; });\n  const output = zlib.createGzip();\n  output.pipe(response);\n\n  setInterval(() =&gt; {\n    output.write(`The current time is ${Date()}\\n`, () =&gt; {\n      // The data has been passed to zlib, but the compression algorithm may\n      // have decided to buffer the data for more efficient compression.\n      // Calling .flush() will make the data available as soon as the client\n      // is ready to receive it.\n      output.flush();\n    });\n  }, 1000);\n}).listen(1337);\n\nConstants\n\n\nAll of the constants defined in zlib.h are also defined on\nrequire(&#39;zlib&#39;).constants. In the normal course of operations, it will not be\nnecessary to use these  constants. They are documented so that their presence is\nnot surprising. This section is taken almost directly from the\nzlib documentation.  See http://zlib.net/manual.html#Constants for more\ndetails.\nNote: Previously, the constants were available directly from \nrequire(&#39;zlib&#39;), for instance zlib.Z_NO_FLUSH. Accessing the constants\ndirectly from the module is currently still possible but should be considered\ndeprecated.\nAllowed flush values.\n\nzlib.constants.Z_NO_FLUSH\nzlib.constants.Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH\nzlib.constants.Z_SYNC_FLUSH\nzlib.constants.Z_FULL_FLUSH\nzlib.constants.Z_FINISH\nzlib.constants.Z_BLOCK\nzlib.constants.Z_TREES\n\nReturn codes for the compression/decompression functions.

Don&#39;t call this frivolously, premature flushes negatively\nimpact the effectiveness of the compression algorithm.\nCalling this only flushes data from the internal zlib state, and does not\nperform flushing of any kind on the streams level. Rather, it behaves like a\nnormal call to .write(), i.e. it will be queued up behind other pending\nwrites and will only produce output when data is being read from the stream.\nzlib.params(level, strategy, callback)\n\nDynamically update the compression level and compression strategy.\nOnly applicable to deflate algorithm.\nzlib.reset()\n\nzlib.constants\nProvides an object enumerating Zlib-related constants.\nReset the compressor/decompressor to factory defaults.
